Decro and his friends had pre-ordered "Virtual Adventure Cataclysm Online", or VAC online for short and were prepared to log on the moment the login servers opened.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro, a white arctic wolf, was seated in a specially-designed chair that was designed to provide a fully immersive experience as it closed around the player like a suit of armour. The VR headset was secured around his head and a spinal attachment was clamped to his back.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="bold">"You guys ready?" he asked his friends over the online voice chat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Sure!", "Duh," "You bet," came all the excited replies and the wolf grinned back.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">"Let's go," he said as they all logged onto the servers.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="bold italic">Decro's first few moments in the game had been intense; not only were the graphics realistic but every single sensation was fed to his body as if he were truly experiencing them in real life. If not for the fantasy trees and shrubs, floating islands in the air, and the triple moon in the sky, he could've sworn that this was real life. He was standing on the top of a gentle hill among rolling fields of pastel green, blue, and pink grass.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="underline">"Whoa," he heard a voice behind him and he turned around to see a minotaur, "Decro, you look just like yourself!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="strikethrough">Decro chuckled at the statement; a weird one to make but very applicable all the same. He looked at his arms and body to see everything, from his fur to his hands, from his tail to his body markings, looking exactly as how it in real life.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You're looking like yourself too, Zig," Decro grinned, "So does the sensory feedback work?" Without waiting for a response, he gave the minotaur a friendly punch to the side of his shoulder.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>"Ouch! That actually </span><span class="strikethrough">hurt</span><span>!" Zig held his shoulder in pain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"</span><span class="underline">Whoops, sorry" the wolf grinned sheepishly, but before he could react, the minotaur charged at him and tackled. </span><span class="underline strikethrough">"Revenge!</span><span class="strikethrough">" Zig yelled. The both of them rolled down the hill as the grass cushioned their descent until they were at the bottom.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-right"><span>"Are you kids done?" a female voice asked sarcastically. Decro immediately recognized her distinct voice: Jasmine the flamingo. She was standing beside Raxmei the rat, another friend.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Just testing out the combat system," Zig grinned innocently before giving </span><img src="img-0.png" class="image"><span> Decro a punch to his shoulder.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-center"><img src="img-1.png" class="image"></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ End ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
