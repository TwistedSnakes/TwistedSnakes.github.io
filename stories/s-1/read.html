    <div id="story-form"><div class="story-container"><div class="story"><p class="title align-left">A Dragon’s Weight in Gold</p><p class="subtitle align-left">Written by TwistedSnakes</p><div class="title-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kairon was leaning back in his leather chair one Saturday afternoon when the doorbell rang. It was a Saturday so he wasn't expecting anyone coming to his office. Technically his mansion functioned as both a home and an office, saving him the trouble of traveling between work. Dragons typically don't have friends, and he wasn't an exception, so he wasn't expecting anyone coming over on the weekends.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The doorbell rang again, twice this time. The visitor must be impatient. "He can wait," Kairon thought to himself, "who does the visitor think he is anyway?" Slowly getting off the elegant chair, he stretched his dark-scaled body, lifting his scales so that air got to the skin underneath. His scales were generally dark onyx-coloured, with a slight hint of blue, save for the blue stripes that ran parallel to his torso, arms, legs and wings. It gave him a very slimming, streamlined look on top of his lean muscular body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He stretched his wings and yawned one more time as he went to the door. Another advantage of working from home: he didn't need to wear constricting shirts that trapped his wings against his back. He did wear pants however, which was convenient seeing that he has a visitor now. As he opened the door, he saw a short fox standing at the door with a parcel. "Delivery for Mr Kairon sir!" the fox announced cheerfully. "That would be me. Anything else?" Kairon said in a business-like tone. "Nope! Have a good day sir!" he chirped as he bounded down to pavement to his delivery truck. Kairon looked at the fox in annoyance. He didn't like how happy the fox seemed, to the point of resentment. "How can anyone be that happy anyway." He went back inside and slammed the door close.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>One ripped parcel later, he had a silver plaque and a laminated certificate in his hands. "Best Director of the Year, Nivion Inc" it said. Finally they were noticing his contributions. Nivion was one of the worst companies he invested in, losing his money. So as the biggest stakeholder, he made some board decisions, ran a tighter ship, and increased efficiency overall. Sure, some people were not happy, but the stocks rose to staggering highs within a month, and he got his money's worth. He didn't need friends anyway.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He tossed the package into the trash. A sheet of paper slipped out of it, floating onto the ground. "What's that?" Kairon thought, picking it up. "Greetings Kairon," it read, "We want to thank you for your contributions to the company. With you, we have reached heights we never thought we'd even catch a glimpse of. As such, we'd like commemorate your contributions with a golden statue of you in our company lobby. Please come to our office this Monday at 11am to model for our goldsmith. Many thanks, Felix the Fox, CEO, Nivion Inc".</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kairon scoffed. Did they just assume he was free? Of course they did. "Disrespectful," Kairon thought. In truth he was free though, and he wouldn't give up the chance to have a statue of him in the company lobby. Perhaps they still had some hope left.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'm here to see Felix," Kairon said flatly to the receptionist. "Oh, he's waiting for you on the 3rd floor, lab 29" she smiled. "More happy people," Kairon grimaced. He made his way to the labs. Walking through the door without knocking, he announced "I'm here" to the waiting Felix. "I noticed you weren't there to escort me up to the labs. Take note of that in future when I come over," he said sternly. For a flash Felix looked a little irked, muttering under his breath, but he quickly put on a smile "Of course, sorry I got caught up in all the excitement."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I don't see the goldsmith here," Kairon stated.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh you know how they are, always late," Felix brushed his concern aside.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Better not keep me waiting", Kairon said flatly. It sounded like a threat. Perhaps it was, but Kairon hoped Felix didn't have to find out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Now we'll need to work on a pose anyway, so we've got time. Come stand on this platform," Felix pointed to a shiny metallic disc on the ground.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kairon stepped up to the disc. As he centered himself on the platform, Felix pressed a button, sending an electric field shooting from the disc, going up Kairon's body. "What the," he managed before his entire body was stunned in place. He could only manage to move his eyeballs, and his eyes darted in panic around the room. "Now, we'll explain this later. We got work to do with your body, reposing it and stuff. See you when you wake up." Felix pressed another button and a stronger shock knocked Kairon out.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kairon slowly opened his eyes. Ugh waking up is such a chore in the morning. His body ached too, probably from a bad sleeping position. He tried to stretch, but his eyes widened when he realized he couldn't. In fact, his entire body was immobile, trapped in a metal frame that had strips of steel going around his body lengthwise and heightwise. A steel ring was also forced in the back of his jaw, keeping it open in an uncomfortable position. His body was also naked, showing off his scaled body, except for his crotch which was wearing a tight latex rectangular briefs. "Wha tha?" he could mouth through the ring in his jaw.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Rise and shine sleepyhead," Felix chirped. Damn him and his happy attitude. Kairon would kill him if he could get out of this frame. "Don't worry about getting out of here: you can't without help." Felix interrupted his thoughts. "Farhk yerr," was all Kairon could manage.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well I'll get straight to the point. Frankly, you've been quite the annoyance around here, bossing around my employees like that. You fired a third of my good employees, scared another third into quitting, and the remaining employees had to pick up the slack. I'm honestly quite surprised they haven't left already. I'm surprised our stocks rose so high, but that's probably your market manipulation anyway." Felix was right, Kairon did pull a little strings here and there to get the results. What can he say, results made him look good. "Anyway," Felix continued, "this calls for a punishment. No no not money, you're not buying yourself out of this one."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Instead, we'll have some fun with you." He clapped his hands, and a counter of equipment slid out from the wall. Picking up a silver disc, he popped it into Kairon's latex underwear, in front of his slit. Pressing a remote on the counter, the disc began vibrating. "Yerr secko," Kairon complained. What was Felix doing to him? This is totally uncalled for. He'd find a way to punish him for this. But first he needed to get out. Unfortunately for Kairon, the only thing getting out was his aroused dick, forming a sizable bulge in his briefs. He was uncomfortably aroused, and he could do nothing to help it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Felix bounced over to Kairon, his bushy tail flying out behind him. Poking at the bulge playfully, he grinned as Kairon struggled against his bonds. He continued pushing at the bulge intentionally, slowly shifting Kairon's scaly dick through a rubber ring in his briefs. Once Kairon dick was on full display, Felix took out the vibrating disc. "How was that? Had enough?" More muffled profanities erupted from Kairon's gagged mouth. "That's cute. Now as we both know, you'll probably want my neck when you get out. Or at least, if you get out. So for my safety we need to test this frame to make sure you can't."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kairon eyed Felix as he disappeared behind his back. "What was he doing?" Kairon wondered. His question was soon answered as a cold rubber plug was shoved into his hindquarters. A few squeezes of the attached pump, and the plug expanded to fill his ass. With something that size, there was no way he could expel that, though it didn't stop him from trying in vain. "FUCK," he thought. He needed to get out of this frame keeping him prison! He struggled against the frame, but it didn't yield. The entire thing was screwed onto the metal platform below him, so it's not like he was going anywhere. "Now, are you sure that's your best you can give? Come on we need to test this cage."  Another button press and the plug started vibrating. "ARGHHH," he half-screamed, half-moaned. Dammit if he got out of here, he'd destroy Nivion. He'd smash the fox's head into a wall. He'd get him run over by a train. He'd throw him off the cliff. Dammit he will pay! His rage fueled his struggles, and he was pulling at the metal with all his strength. The metal frame was digging into his scales as he tried to twist and turn, yet nothing gave way.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Alright, I think this is great. My metal cage works! After all, it's made from the strongest steel lying around. Dragon-proof steel, pretty good stuff. And it's welded together, so it's pretty much permanent for you." Kairon's eyes widened. Permanent? Come on he can't be serious can he? Another wave of intense vibrations came over him, interrupting his thoughts, making him blush in pleasure. "Oh are you actually enjoying this? Okay then, I was thinking of going home any way. It's late you know, and I've actually worked long hours today." He tapped a few buttons on the control panel, setting the plug to vibrate in cycles. Each cycle was calibrated to make Kairon get aroused, almost to the point of release, then leave him hanging, with a weak vibration to remind him of what could have been. "Okay done. Have fun with this!" Felix flicked a switch as he walked out the door, plunging the room into darkness, with nothing but the sound of a dragon in distress, and a vibrator deep inside him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kairon spent the night in anguish. An hour into the torture, he was starting to get horny, and he wanted release. But each time he came close, the vibrations would subside. Unable to sleep, he kept trying to thrust his hips, anything for release, but he couldn't move. Dammit why is this happening to him?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Felix showed up the next morning. He was greeted by a dragon squinting from the sudden flood of light, moaning and trying to get release. Kairon's scaly dick was hard, extended away from his body, curved upwards. Amused by the scene, Felix released air from the plug, and slid it out of Kairon. Kairon heaved a sigh of relief.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Felix walked over to the counter. He was going to have a little more fun with the dragon. Grabbing a ring, he went over to Kairon, sliding the ring over his dick. The cold metal sent shivers up Kairon's spine. He was so exhausted from the sleepless night, he just moaned. "Aww, no profanity for me today? Good boy." He reached up to pat Kairon on his head. Kairon growled at the back of his throat. "That's cute."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Now pay attention to this," Felix announced. He reached down and gripped Kairon's rigid dick, and pulled down. Kairon heard a snap, and felt something come off from his crotch. He panicked again, and Felix brought up his black scaly dick in front of him. What the fuck! "Haha just kidding. It's still here. This pair of rings are portals. Dick goes in here, comes out here. Easy." Felix groped Kairon's crotch through the bars, caressing his now-smooth crotch up and down, almost taunting him for his missing dick. Kairon let out more threats and vulgarities. "Now shh you," Felix ordered. "Maybe this will shut you up." He reached up and shoved the disconnected cock down his throat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kairon was stunned by the sheer audacity of what Felix was making him do. His own dick was forced into his mouth! However, he was still horny from the night before, and his warm mouth gave him a good feeling on his dick. He gingerly licked his cock. A wave of pleasure came out. Dammit he didn't have to do this. He was better than this! Sucking his own dick just because he was horny was definitely unprofessional. But it felt so good...and he was desperate. Within the minute he was sucking himself off.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was a few minutes of ultimate pleasure. He had never received a blowjob so good. He climaxed, and a stream of warm cum squirted down his throat. "Fuck," he thought. Felix pulled out Kairon's dripping cock. "Enough fun for you. Let's get down to business." Felix grabbed a rubbery mass from the counter and opened it out, revealing it to be a latex mask. He slid it under the metal frame, working it down over Kairon's head. It was form fitting, hugging his head tightly and even covering the shape of his open maw. It pressed his tongue down to the bottom of his jaw, and he could only make guttural moans. The eyes were 2 dark-tinted lenses, dimming the rest of the world to him. There were some tubes sticking out from the inside of the mask. Through the latex, Felix pushed the two smaller ones up his nostrils, and the larger one down his throat. From the outside, the tubes could not be seen. The only hint that they were there were the circular valves in his mouth and nostrils.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Going around to the back, Felix applied some lubricant onto a black rubber tube with a rounded end. He nudged the round end up Kairon's butt crack, massaging the area. Kairon felt a little more aroused, and it showed on his excited cock on the table. "Brace yourself, this might hurt," Felix warned, a smug grin on his face. Then he pushed the tube all the way in. If Kairon wasn't framed the way he was, he would've jumped ten feet in the air. Instead, he could only squeal from the back of his throat. "Aww that that hurt? We need that to keep full-access to your tight ass. Don't worry, you have plenty of time to get used to that. I added some superglue on the surface of that dildo, so it's gonna be there permanently." Felix went to squeeze Kairon's crotch again, fondling his giant ballsack pressed against his body by the latex briefs.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>What was happening to him? Kairon wondered. He was a little scared. Perhaps even sorry for what he've done. But dammit there has to be a way out of here.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Felix used the control panel to lower a hook, and he hooked it over Kairon's framed body. Now behind the control panel, Felix lifted Kairon up, moved him to another part of the room, where there was a pit sloshing around with some black liquid. The smell rose up so Kairon could get a good whiff. "Rubber?" he thought.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So before we get that gold statue of you, we got to work on some primer layers. You'll see what I mean," Felix explained. Wait what, a statue? Is that still happening? Felix tapped another button, and Kairon's framed body was slowly lowered into the pit. "Oh let's not leave this out," Felix remembered, hooking Kairon's detached dick onto another chain to be dipped into the latex.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kairon felt heavier as the sticky latex lapped against his feet, sucking him in deeper into the pit. As his thighs went in, he could feel the weight of the thick latex pressing against his body. His crotch went in next. The sloshing latex massaged his sensitive balls, although his cock got none of that. A moan escaped the back of his throat. The latex seeped between his briefs and his scales, sticking them together. Within half a minute, the rest of the latex has covered his chest, and then his head.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The latex didn't enter his nostrils due to the valve, but that didn't mean he was getting any air. He was forced to hold his breath as he was lowered deeper in. He could feel the tip of his exposed dick touching the warm latex, and he let out another moan as the latex sucked his dick in. He was running out of air, and his lungs were on fire. His instinct was to shout for help, yet any shouting would cost him his precious oxygen. He fought against his insane urge to breathe, struggling and trying to shift within the frame.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As he was going to pass out, suddenly there was light, and his body was taken out of the latex. Huge industrial fans were blowing at his body, rapidly cooling and solidifying the latex against his scales, while blowing the excess off. Kairon was too busy catching his breath from the near-death experience to notice, so he was startled when the fans went off, and some heating elements turned on, focusing their warm glow onto his latex-coated body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The latex suit on him shrank, squeezing tightly against his body. The latex shaped around his form, bringing out details from his muscles. His two balls formed a sizable sack at his crotch, devoid of the form of his cock. The latex skin was so tight, it even brought out the texture of his scales. The latex didn't stick to the valve or his eye lenses, so he could still use them. Kairon felt exhausted. He was not used to such extreme conditions, and being subjected to such torture is a lot to take in. He panted, trying to catch some breath. He still needed to get out of there though, so between his tired breaths he begged to be let out. All that came out was a incomprehensible murmur from behind his latex-packed body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Felix admired his handiwork. He has brought the big bully down to his knees in shame. But his plan for Kairon was so much more than that, and that got him excited. Adding some functionality into the controller, he programmed the chains, fans and heaters to repeat the same process of dipping, drying and shrinking again. "Have fun!" he bade Kairon as he made another trip down into the breath-sucking latex pit. He could make out Kairon's screaming eyes behind the dark lenses. Hmm, perhaps he should fix that with more opaque lenses tomorrow. But he was done for work for today, at least.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kairon spent another sleepless night, catching his breath during the drying phase, then suffocating as he went down again. His body was slowly getting coated with thicker and thicker layers, pressing against his body in uncomfortable ways. Each cycle, In the few minutes he spent catching his breath, he would fade in and out of sleep. Whenever he was lowered in, he would jerk awake, thrash for air, and thoughts would run wild, buzzing with thoughts of a sleep-deprived mind. He'd wish for death at times, then he'd have imagery of being set free. Then another futile gasp for air, and he was wishing for death again. He would then be lifted out of the latex, and he'd fall asleep while catching his breath.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was suddenly jerked awake as his platform gently bumped against the ground. Was he done at last? Ugh, the best he could do now was catch up on the past two nights of sleep. "Bam!" the lab door opened, flooding the place with lights. Despite the lack of sleep, the irony was not lost on Kairon. He groaned in fatigue, mental and physical.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Not bothering to greet Kairon, Felix bounded over to see his handiwork. The metal frame, being tightly pressed against Kairon's scales before the process, got buried somewhere in the layers of latex. Kairon's muscular were brought out very nicely, and the details of his scales were still replicated on the hardened latex. His entire body was in an action pose, as if ready to strike his enemies. One foot was forward, and the other foot was behind in a stable formation, knees bent to give a little more stability. His two arms were poised, claws ready to strike. His wings were spread, ready to take flight at his target. His face was faced forward, eyes (or at least, dark lenses) searching for enemies. Indeed, this would be his masterpiece. He quite liked this position for Kairon. In fact his positioning also exposed his cute bubble butt, and the rubber tube left his anal open for exploitations.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"In case your dense brain didn't figure it out," Felix gloated, "here's what's happening. We are still going to have that statue of you, don't you worry about that. What might be new to you is that you are going to be a part of it. It's much cheaper to make, we just need to coat you with some gold."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kairon's tired brain snapped into attention. Was that what all this was about? No, he gotta let him go. He had places to be, things to do, a life to live! Fuck fuck fuck. But Felix ignored his groans, instead using the hooks, he put Kairon onto a wheeled platform, and wheeled him out of the lab.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Along the corridor, Kairon could see employees stopping their work to stare at him. Some were pointing, some snickering even. Kairon didn't blame them for that. After all, he did made their lives a living hell over the past month. But it needed to be done. Felix wasn't doing his job as a CEO. But all this could've been avoided if he was a little nicer... But it was too late for regrets.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was brought to another lab, and positioned under a lot of mechanical arms, each tipped with a metal nozzle. Felix brought out a few electronic devices, with sticky pads and metal rods attached. He stuck the sticky pads on Kairon's chest, above his latex-coated nipples. Felix moved to Kairon's open ass, his hand feeling up the rubber tube that was keeping Kairon's ass open. Massaging the sides to get it looser, he pushed a giant metal plug in, and filled Kairon's insides with cold solid metal.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Felix went over to Kairon's cock and attached it to its rightful position. Stroking its scaly underside, it twitched in excitement. Kairon blushed again. He was still uncomfortable with being sexually harassed by this fox that he was used to pushing around. As his cock got rock hard, Felix swiftly in a lubricated metal rod down his shaft. Kairon squeaked from under the rubber, the ribbed rod displacing some residual cum left in his shaft.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Felix grabbed the rod, sliding it up and down Kairon's urethral shaft, causing both pain and pleasure as the ribs rubbed the inside of his shaft. Kairon was helpless in escaping this treatment. After he saw Kairon had enough, Felix pushed the metal rod to the deepest point in Kairon, nudging his urethral sphincters and forcing them open. Another low-pitched squeal emerged from Kairon's rubbery throat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Flicking a switch on the devices, Kairon's body was suddenly gripped by a powerful electric shock. His body was paralyzed, and he couldn't control his spazzing muscles. His nipples were feeling sensitive from the electrical current, and his dick was twitching.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>“I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time. I’m finally going to make you pay for all the pain you’ve caused me and my company. Who knows how many more companies you’ve ruined for your financial gain. No matter, it ends now.” He pressed a button and the mechanical arms came down, spraying a thin layer of gold all over his body. The electrical current helped attract the gold particles, forming a smooth sheen over his entire body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kairon felt hopelessly trapped. His eyes were shiny and damp in fear. Would he remain a prisoner forever?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>When the process finished, the dark lenses were coated with a layer of gold, making it impossible to see through. Felix turned off the power, and Kairon's body stopped convulsing from under the metal frame, and he removed the pads. He took pleasure in removing the huge plug out of Kairon, whose asshole had contracted from all the spasms. It came out with difficulty, requiring a lot of twisting as it came out. He slapped Kairon's firm butt hard as a punishment for making things difficult. Kairon flinched internally as he felt the slap. He slid out the metal rod out of Kairon's urethra. The rod came out golden, plated from the process. "Looks like the inside of your cock is now golden too. Hope you like it that way," Felix taunted. "Well I'll be taking this back." He gripped Kairon's cock, sending another wave of pleasure across his body, and snapped it off the stand, leaving a smooth golden bulge.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Felix climbed up the golden statue that used to be Kairon, and popped the lenses out. He took out two golden lenses, and glued them to Kairon’s eyes. "Yeah gold is a good color for you. Much better than a plain black. Or did you have blue stripes? Haha does it even matter at this point in time?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>“Now don’t worry, we’ll take good care of you. Your mouth valve is attached to the high-tech base below you, which will feed you with food and water. Your ass is also going to be cleared out by the base, so you can remain here for the rest of your life. You'll be making so many happy, you know that?” Felix grinned.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>“Now I have a set up that you might like.” He pulled over a machine behind Kairon, equipped with a piston. Repositioning Kairon’s golden dick to the end of the piston, he turned on the machine. The machine began moving, pumping his dick in and out of Kairon’s ass. Felix smiled. He made sure the metal coating wouldn't form a thick layer in Kairon's mouth, ass and dick, so he could still feel it when he was used.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It worked, because Kairon felt good, and his sleep deprivation deprived him of proper thoughts. All he could think of was to get release. Each pump got him closer and closer and... "Nuh uh, we can't have that. Statues made are for the pleasure of the viewer, not for its own pleasure," Felix stopped the machine, and inserted a golden rod down Kairon's dick, stopping him from cumming. Kairon's frustrated moans came out. They were so muffled, Felix almost couldn't hear them despite his sensitive fox ears. That meant Kairon would make a really good statue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But to make his victory, he’d need to break Kairon down not just physically, but mentally too. He took out a metal helmet with a visor. It was shaped with flat metal surfaces and sharp corners, with a tinted visor in front. He put it on the golden dragon, its headphones fitting snugly over Kairon's buried earholes, and visor over his eyes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Flicking another remote, the helmet turned on, flashing images of statues in front of his eyes. A mind-washing recording started to play, "You are a statue. A statue exists to bring pleasure and release to its owner. A statue does not need to experience pleasure or relief. You are a statue..."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kairon struggled to block out the voice, but it kept echoing through the helmet, bouncing around in his head. The pictures of statues kept flashing faster and faster, until they eventually faded out to the video feed currently focused on him. He was just looking at himself. After all, he was just a statue. Wait no fuck he was Kairon, the great Kairon. Professional investor, multibillionaire. Why would a statue be someone like that? That's probably someone else. He was only a statue...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Looking at the metrics displayed from the helmet, Felix could tell Kairon's eyes were glazing over. A few more hours and he'd be a proper statue. He detached Kairon's dick from the machine and popped it back onto Kairon's crotch where it belonged. He snapped a few pictures of the great Kairon, brought down to his knees as a living statue of himself. "Hmm, somehow I don't like that dick where it is. Bad statues don't get to have dicks, do they?" He went back and detached the dick, then shoved it back up Kairon's ass. "Now to get ready for your big reveal."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Under a red cloth, Kairon could feel himself being moved around on a wheeled platform, and set down. A few hours later, he heard Felix's voice through speakers all around, "Welcome ladies and gentlemen, good employees of Nivion. Today with us we have invited guests, people who have worked with us before being forced to leave in the crisis in the past month. Please feel welcome here. You are all gathered here for a very important announcement."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"This month," Felix continued, "we have increased our revenue significantly, and we want to celebrate that. Most of this is possible because of a certain director, so we want to thank him for that today. So without further ado, presenting our best director....Kairon!" The cloth was pulled over his head, and spotlights focused on his gleaming body. The crowd cheered. "Now," Felix continued, "the real Kairon couldn't be here with us today. In fact he seemed to be uncontactable ever since we invited him over. But no matter, we will have a statue to commemorate his contributions." The crowd continued cheering, although out of politeness. Perhaps it had something to do with their past interactions with Kairon.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Now, let's be serious. I know most of you didn't like Kairon, and I can understand that. Maybe you didn't like the way he worked, maybe you've felt he has wronged you in some way. But this is why I want to set things right tonight. This statue of Kairon is for you guys to do as you please. If you want the great Kairon to suck your dick, feel free to use his mouth. If you want to get it up in Kairon's ass instead, just use that too! In fact, for the ladies, or the men who are open to that too, we have a replica of Kairon's dick!" Felix announced just as he slid Kairon's dick out of his ass, "But just one thing ladies and gentlmen, don't damage it. It cost me a bomb to make."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Now I'm not kidding about this. Form a queue here, and let's begin!" People of all kinds all flocked to the stage, cheering. The first one came up, a brown ferret anthro. He climbed up to Kairon's head and shoved his dick in. "Told me my work sucked? Well suck on this bitch." he taunted. Another lady horse came up and grabbed Kairon's dick, shoving it up her pussy. "Oh dear, he might be a dick at work, but he can be a dick in me any time." A rhino came up, whipped out his thick dick and rammed it up Kairon’s open ass. Kairon winced from behind his latex mask. But he had to endure as a statue.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>After the event, many of the people who were fired or left the company were re-invited to come back as an employee again. The company grew and flourished, achieving more than they did with Kairon around.The golden statue of Kairon was kept in a recreation room, for employees who needed a little relief every now and then. His ass had taken so many dicks, he felt permanently sore there. His mouth had tasted countless dicks and pussies, and after each use, a cleaner would hose the fluids down the valve into his throat. And after the last person used it for the day, his dick would be placed back on the piston machine to be thrust in and out of his ass. The employees thought it was a hilarious addition, a great insult to the tyranny of Kairon. His silent moans would vibrate through his golden body each night.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A few years later, Nivion could no longer fit all its employees in the office building, and shifted to another location. The next tenant used the recreation room as a storage room, forgetting the golden statue of a dragon. The power to the piston ran out, leaving his dick rammed at the deepest point up his ass, and nothing but the smell of sweat, cum and pussy to keep him company for many years to come.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ End ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
