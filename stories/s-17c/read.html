The three thousand furs were all seated in a huge auditorium filled with rows of plush velvet seats, but millions more were watching the live airing of the feed from the comfort of their homes, offices, and anywhere else with a television.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For the violence-hungry citizens of Osceus, each year's Victor's Cup could not come early enough. In a highly-efficient city where furs moved like cogs in the machine in the clockwork of the city, suppressed personal tendencies had very few outlets to express themselves. Just like the rest of the nation, the Victor's Cup is equally efficient at providing such an outlet. Maximum pleasure. Minimum collateral damage. In the grand scheme of Osceus, the Victor's Cup is but another moving part in the agile drudge of production.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The lights in the auditorium dimmed down, bring with it the noise of the audience that trailed off in hushed whispers as they waited anxiously for the show to start. The curtains were drawn, revealing a huge dark screen.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Our story begins centuries ago when Osceus was no more than individual kingdoms in vast and bountiful lands," an animated scene appeared before the audience over the narration.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"In one such kingdom," the narration continued, "King Sadek ruled strictly but justly. Each year, prisoners on the death row would all be executed together in a public spectacle." Basic shapes that resembled a line of furs standing in a line were decapitated as a white blade sliced across the screen, severing their triangular heads from the rest of the bodies.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"One day," the narration sounded ominous as the pastel colours gave way to dark tones. "The prince was caught red-handed in the act of treason and sentenced to death." A yellow crown spun as it fell through a dark void. "The king was devastated. In an attempt to save his son, he came up with a new law: prisoners on the death row would fight it out in the forest. The one who brings to the king the head of all the other prisoners would walk away a free man."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"A lot has changed since then, turning this morbid deathmatch into a civilized sporting event," the narration continued as out of ashes rose a trophy cup, the emblem of the Victor's Cup. "Without further ado, we bring you, the Victor's Cup!" the voice finished, loudly announcing the last three words with an enthusiastic flourish. The crowd cheered in glee as the screen dimmed and the lights came back on.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Dressed in a white suit, a maroon-skinned shark walked onto the stage, grinning and waving at the roaring audience. "Zaaaaaaaaaach Shenod!" he exclaimed his name and the crowd went wild. "Boom boom boom!" He went to the centre of the stage where two large armchairs were placed facing the audience, standing in front of them as he grinned at the audience.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The cheering subsided after a while. "Welcome to the Victor's Cup once again. We've added a ton of features from the previous years: new map, new weapons, and new oh-so-tempting traps. Boom!" he announced and the crowd cheered again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"But that's not what you guys are here for; you'll have the next few days to watch it all live on television. No no no, what we're all here for is to meet our six tithes." The crowd burst into cheers as music played over the speakers.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Meanwhile backstage, the six tithes were gathered around Jayna as she explained the interview process.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The interviews will be conducted one by one, starting with you," the doe pointed at the sharkip who recoiled in surprise. "Shenod will ask you some personal questions about your history, combat experience and personality. Just answer truthfully. Or not, that's up to you."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And what incentive is there for us to lie?" Dusty interrupted her.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"To increase your bets," she brushed off. Noticing the raised eyebrows of a few of the tithes, she sighed. "People can bet on tithes they think will be the Victor. There's money to be made in the bets. And if you win, you receive ten percent of all the bets on you as prize money."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So," she continued, "if you think that current facts about yourselves are less-than-stellar at charming the audience, you may want to hold off on the truth. Moving on, I advise you to work with Shenod. He's here to help you shine, so the least you could do is to show your best side."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A roar of the crowd can be heard from behind them. "That's your cue," Jayna turned to the sharkip. "You're up."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The music faded out and the audience turned their focus to the pair of furs seated on two armchairs in the middle of the stage. Shenod was seated on the left, leaned forward as if confident and eager to pounce on Kip, who in contrast was seated on the right, sinking into his seat as he stared nervously at the crowd.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So how did you feel about being the only non-volunteering tithe in this competition?" Shenod repeated.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Huh?" Kip snapped out of his fearful trance and looked at the host. "I guess it's like winning the lottery, but only in a bad way?" he stammered. The audience burst into laughter at his response.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Aww," a look of concern flashed across the shark's face. "Has the week of preparation helped you with that?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"No...I guess not..." Kip said reluctantly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The audience looked at the pair uncomfortably. Ready to salvage the situation, Shenod opened his mouth to speak but the sharkip continued, "But I know how to blow shit up now." The audience roared with laughter.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hahaha, yes, yes. That will be quite a sight to behold. We're going to have to hold you up to that promise, isn't that right people!" Shenod turned to the audience with his arms raised in the air. The crowd whooped in glee. "Bang!" the shark exclaimed too, punching his fist in the air.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>When the audience quietened down, Shenod turned back to the sharkip. "So what are your family think of you entering the competition?" he asked.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The question caught Kip off guard. "I..." he stammered. He thought of his parents and his two younger brothers. What would they think if he never came back from the tournament? But those were rumours, right? As far as the Cup was concerned, everyone returned home from the tournament safe and sound.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I hope they're proud of me no matter what happens," he finally replied. Shenod nodded with a knowing look as he placed a hand on his shoulder. "I'm sure they'll be proud of you. I bet they're watching you right now from behind their television sets." He turned to the cameras and reassured, "Don't worry Mr and Mrs Kip your son will do his very best in the arena. People, don't you think so too?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The crowd went wild. "Alright folks," Shenod's voice rose from the speakers over the cheers of the crowd. "Let's give it up for...Kip the Sharkip! Bang!"</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So Dusty, rumours said you signed up for the Cup while you were drunk," Shenod studied the husky curiously. "Enlighten us, is that true?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Every single word," Dusty confirmed, sending the crowd into fits of mirth. "But I guess deep inside me, I know I can win, and drunk-me must've figured it out and decided to do me a favour."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Wow, very deep," Shenod nodded. "So what makes you think you can win?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What, are you doubting me already Zach?" Dusty jested, and the easily-entertained crowd roared in laughter.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Bang! Oh dear me no!" the shark protested, holding his hands up in surrender. "I think everyone here has a good chance of winning this. In fact, just today I was considering putting down another five thousand on you."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What? Only five thousand? If I were you I'd put down ten!" Dusty jokingly retorted as if offended.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Shenod didn't skip a beat. "Oh, only if you'd sponsor the other five thousand," he laughed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There were a few seconds of laughter from everyone before everyone quietened down again in amused sighs.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"On a serious note, I know I might seem small in stature," Dusty explained. "And that's why I've been playing to my strengths." He tapped his temple referring to his mental prowess. "I know every trick in the book what it takes to win. Machiavelli. Sun Tzu. Clausewitz. You name it, I've read it."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He leaned forward in his seat and gave the camera an intense look. His gaze was broadcasted on huge screens in the auditorium as well as on millions of television across the nation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I have what it takes to outwit, outplay, and outlast every other tithe in the arena."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So, I daresay that before you signed up for the Cup, neither I nor anyone in the audience has even heard of you," the shark stated, leaning in towards Niall, who was leaning back in his chair as if deep in thought.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Talking over Niall's silence, Shenod continued "I mean, I do a web search with your name and nothing shows up. Can you imagine? Nothing!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The hyena continued sitting in his chair in silence.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Still with us Niall?" the shark looked at him in concern.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yes. You didn't ask a question," Niall stated flatly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Very true, very true. You got me there," Shenod gave the crowd a cheesy and sheepish smile. "Let me phrase it this way: after years of being unheard of by the general public, what brings you here today?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was an awkward pause as the shark looked at the hyena askingly. He was about to open his mouth to add something more when Niall spoke up. "Fun," he said curtly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fun! That's what the Victor's Cup is all about. Isn't that right people?" Shenod cheered the crowd on as they roared in delight. "So, I know there are a lot of things to love about the Victor's Cup, but could you share with us just one thing about it you find fun?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Winning," the hyena answered without hesitation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Bang! I can't agree with you more," Shenod guffawed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"To engage in battle and eliminate the other tithes," Niall continued, ignoring the shark. "And then to claim all the prize money."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Shenod was taken aback for a second at the hyena's directness, although he hid it well as he followed up with his reply. "Very nice. I can't wait to see what you've got in store for us."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I am the predator, and the tithes are my prey. And I will hunt every last one of them down until I am the only one left." He took out his pocket knife and began playing with it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"That's the mentality I like, don't we all?" Shenod asked the crowd as he stole a glance at the knife. The crowd cheered again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The hyena took the knife and stabbed it between his fingers into the chair's armrest, the blade piercing the fabric and lodging itself into the wooden frame below. Furs in the audience gasped in fear and the crowd went silent.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Shenod, however, seemed unfazed. "Bang! Let's give it up for Niall!"</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And what's your strategy once you're in the arena?" Shenod nodded at Blue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I don't know," Blue smiled sheepishly. "I guess I'll need to figure it out once I get there."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So you know any of the other tithes?" the shark asked concernedly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, Teryx has been nice to me so far," she pondered. "Actually everyone has been nice to me."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And who are you going to team up with?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ahh! I don't know," she moaned. "I really don't want to fight any of them."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Surely you can't do that to win?" the shark challenged.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, I'll fight if I have to, but I won't like it," Blue admitted. "But I don't like violence," she winced as if in pain and hunched over in a nervous huddle. Shenod moved over to her and gave her a hug, and the audience let out a collective "aww".</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Feeling better?" the shark asked after a while. Blue nodded. "Thanks so much," she smiled.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, I hope that you know what you're doing when you're in the arena. Best of luck to you," he turned to the audience. "Ladies and gentlemen, Blue!"</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well Rhogar, the people who bet on you will be happy to hear that you're proficient in many different weapons. Daggers, swords, polearms, bow and arrow, firearms, what more could we ask for?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Rhogar retorted with a snort of disdain. "Yeah, so?" he replied curtly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I think I speak for everyone when I say that we want to know where you've gotten all this extensive training from," Shenod smiled warmly, a stark contrast to Rhogar's cold demeanour.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I was forced to learn it. To survive," Rhogar commented.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You do what you must, you do what you must," the shark nodded empathetically.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You don't know half of it," Rhogar grunted, cutting Shenod off.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And that's why we'd all like to know more," the shark looked at him in concerned. "I mean if you're okay with sharing with us, of course."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Rhogar furrowed his brows, intending to brush off the question. However, he changed his mind as he saw the look of genuine concern from both Shenod and the audience, all of them hoping to hear his story.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I was...coerced into being a mercenary," Rhogar admitted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh dear, when was this?" he probed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"When I was seven."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There were audible gasps from the audience and even Shenod seemed to be looking for words of comfort.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"It was a choice between learning to use whatever weapons I had on hand or dying," Rhogar shrugged. "It wasn't a tough decision."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I picked up swords and daggers at first," Rhogar continued. "Then when I had nothing but a metal pole to defend myself, the polearm was an obvious transition. Eventually, I picked up ranged weapons when I needed to attack from a distance. Everything was I learnt was do or die."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, I am so sorry for your past. All of Osceus' hearts go out to you. I'm sure you'll do well in the arena. Don't we all agree folks?" the shark turned to the audience enthusiastically, evoking more cheers from them.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Rhogar looked at Shenod, then at the crowd, then back at Shenod as the shark put a hand on his shoulder.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"At least this battle is one that you chose to be in."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Teryx waved to the audience as stepped onto the stage. Taking the lead, the blue dragon went ahead to introduce himself. "Teryx Commodore!" he raised his hand in the air, leading the crowd in wild cheers over him. Grinning smugly, he ran his clawed fingers through his golden mane, letting it fall behind him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He flashed everyone a huge, confident grin before sitting down on the large chair beside Shenod who seemed to be enjoying the show along with the rest of the audience. "You're quite the popular one Teryx," the shark complimented. "When I first saw you five years ago on television, my first thought was 'I wish one day I could be interviewing you for the Victor's Cup.' The gods must have heard my prayers because here you are! We're all honoured to have you here tonight, aren't we people?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cheers and whoops came from the crowd, especially from Teryx's fans in the crowd. Teryx shook his head modestly. "No Shenod, the honour is mine. Meeting you face to face is so much better than everything I've seen on television."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hahaha, bang!" the shark guffawed. "Are you trying to butter me up?" he quipped.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"It's not buttering up if it's true," Teryx grinned back.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well said!" Shenod let out another round of hearty laughter, leading the crowd in more roars of joy.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"On a serious note," the shark continued after the auditorium quietened down. "I think we all would like to know what brings you here to the Victor's Cup? I mean, there was no hesitation at all. An hour of the registration opening and you have volunteered to be a tithe. An hour, imagine that!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'm here to win," the dragon declared confidently, leaning back against his chair as if those four words explained everything.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And I don't expect any less of you Teryx," Shenod nodded. "Although I am obligated to warn you: all the other tithes are gunning for the position of the Victor too."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"They can try," Teryx nodded. "And I do hope they'll try their best. But in the end, I'm going to win. After all, with all of you supporting me, I can't find it within me to disappoint you guys!" he turned to the audience and offered his palm up to them.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Bang! Marvellous! I can't wait to see what you've got for us," Shenod grinned. "Now it's not that I don't trust you, because I think you stand a great chance at winning this, but what happens on the teensy-weensy chance that you're eliminated by another tithe?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Teryx face turned dark for a while, but it went away as a smile flashed across his face. "That's not an option. I can't afford to lose: the consequences are too much."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The shark was taken aback. "What do you mean, 'too much'? I mean, after the Cup, everyone goes back home and life goes on. So what's on your mind?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The Victor's Cup isn't all fun and games, is it Shenod?" the dragon turned to the shark. Without waiting for a reply, he turned to the nearest camera and gave it a dark look. From backstage, Kip watched Teryx's intense glare.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The lesser-known half of the Victor's Cup tale tells us that much. After all, when the very first Victor's Cup game ended, King Sadek struck the Victor down where he stood," Teryx explained.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The crowd watched by in shock and even Shenod looked at a loss for words. The dragon continued, "I don't blame him. Wouldn't you want revenge on the man who killed your son?"</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ To be continued ~</span></div></div></div></div><div class="suffix-container"><div class="suffix-text"><div><div class="align-center"><a href="../s-17b/read.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> <a href="../s-17d/read.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></div></div></div></div></div>
