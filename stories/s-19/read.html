        The time was 8:52 a.m. when Decro walked into the lobby of IRIS. My facial-recognition system had no trouble picking the arctic wolf out from the crowd, wearing a white shirt, a dark blue hoodie and jeans. He had an optimization procedure scheduled at 9 a.m. so I was expecting him. With a fizzle that looked like the turning on of a mechanical television, a hologram of me appeared in front of him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The wolf jumped back in surprise. "Oh, hi," he greeted me. "Is this IRIS? I'm here for the optimization procedure?" he asked.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Yes, yes!" I responded in glee. "I've been expecting you." The happiness module programmed into my speech was meant to help put my conversation partners at ease, although it didn't seem particularly effective on Decro.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Huh?" he was taken aback by my cheeriness. "Oh yeah, I'm Decro," he introduced himself. "But I guess you already knew that, huh?" he scratched his head sheepishly. "The instructions told me to report here. What do you need me to do for the procedure?"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        I flashed a charming smile at him in response to his visible discomfort. "Right on time, I have a good feeling about you," I reassured him. "If you could just head through that door someone will be with you shortly," I pointed to a door with the sign "Lab Access" next to it. As he made his way to the lab, I disappeared in the same fizzle, reappearing in the lab.
       </span>

        The contract was already on the metal desk beside me. Decro had applied for the Full Life Optimization Procedure, or FLOP for short, where we will aim to optimize the subject's life in specific aspects based on the changes they are willing to make. Decro had specified that he wanted to improve his financial situation, physical fitness, and maximize happiness, and was willing to allow us to change his lifestyle, diet, job, behavior, and storage situation. More than enough for the procedure I have in mind.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        He appeared through the lab doorway. Noticing me, he called out "Oh, hey," and stood awkwardly by, watching me expectantly. I glided over to Decro and directed him over to the table. "These are the forms you have filled in on the IRIS website in printed form. We will need you to sign on the line to officially agree to the procedure."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Decro looked through the notes as I continued. "After that, we can begin your physical and carry on with the real fun." The wolf nodded as he checked the last of the forms. I'm surprised he seemed fine with allowing us to optimize his "Storage" situation. Most subjects opted out of storage solutions once they found out what it involved, and those remaining limited it to at most a month of storage. Still, once he signs the form, it's legal.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Decro turned to me and asked, "So, how does FLOP work?"

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Well Decro," I began. "Here at IRIS we have some of the most advanced technologies to upgrade and sustain a person's physical form. Since you agreed to greater flexibility for us to optimize your lifestyle habits, I can offer you a "Better Life" package which will help you achieve your goals of "financial well-being", "physical fitness", and "happiness".

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "That sounds good," the wolf nodded. Picking up the pen, he signed on the bottom of each page.

        I could hardly contain my excitement. The first time we're trying this procedure with a willing subject! With my mind connected to the room's control system, I slid the desk back into the wall and made a metal examination table rise from the ground. Multiple computer stations also rose from the ground, each with a blinking display.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "I need you to strip down to your underwear and lie on this table, please," I smiled warmly at him. He blushed a little, before taking off his hoodie and shirt, folding them carefully into a pile and setting them on a chair beside him. His shoes and jeans came off too, and were neatly placed with his other clothes, leaving the wolf wearing a pair of tight black trunks. He gingerly climbed onto the metal table and laid down.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        I directed various mechanical arms down from the ceiling towards the wolf, each of them equipped with a different scanner as it examined him. I fizzled between the different computer stations to monitor his vital signs. Very healthy specimen. With a few taps of the keyboard, his health details was saved.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Very good," I congratulated him. "You're fit for the procedure. I will need you to stand in this circle," I pointed to a circle in the middle of the room. The circle was about the length of a full arm span and the floor within it was lower than the rest of the room.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        He walked over to the circle and stood within it. Time for the procedure. The ground below him opened up, letting him fall into the vat below. Unfortunately, his reactions were fast. With a yelp of surprise, he caught the edge of the hole in time as his feet dangled into the empty vat below.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Hey! What gives?" he protested. Ugh, what's this guy? I glide over to the edge of the hole and towered over him. Decro could definitely see my face of slight displeasement. "Uhh, what are you doing?" he asked nervously.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "We're solving your problems by putting your body into storage until the post-scarcity age, which should happen in 912 years, 4 months, and 19 days. Plus-minus a century or so," I answered sternly.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "I-I don't get it. You're supposed to improve my life!" he tried to pull himself out of the hole. Something I will not allow. I brought a giant metal claw down on Decro and grabbed him by the waist. It pulled downwards into the vat. "Please! What are you doing?" he pleaded. "Help!"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        This resistance is getting on my nerves. I lifted my leg over Decro's head, and stomped down on him. My body may have been a hologram, but the effects were real. He flinched in surprise and loosened his hold on the ledge. That was enough for the claw to pull him into the hole. He landed in the bottom of the vat and looked around.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        I fizzled to the lower floor to watch the arctic wolf.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The vat was made of heavy, reinforced steel and thick, tempered glass. The claw tugged against Decro's trunks and tore it, fully stripping him. It pulled the fabric remnants out of the vat and placed the lid on the vat, wielding it in place with an airtight seal.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Hey!" he banged on the glass. "Let me out!" I ignored him. Bio stimulation gel gushed out of the holes in the ground as it was pumped into the tank. Decro stepped away in surprise, but the level of green goo was rising up to this ankles.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Wait! Stop!" he protested again. Pointless. I scowled at him, but he was too concerned about the goo to notice. It was up to his waist now as he splashed around in the gel. It quickly reached to his chest and up his neck.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        He was swimming in the goo now, tilting his head upwards so that his nostrils could breathe air. That would soon change though. The goo reached to the top of the vat where a small tube was sucking out air, leaving the wolf fully submerged in the gel. He panicked for a few seconds before realizing the goo was breathable.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Now to wait. A holographic clipboard and pen materialized in front of me and I started filling in the storage reports. Administrative work. How inane.

        Okay this is getting old. I can't just cancel your procedure just because you don't want it any more. That's unethical. IRIS prides itself on satisfying every single paying customer, and you're one of them.

        Was worried that the wolf was dead. Thankfully, he is not. That would be disastrous. We have never failed to deliver results. Well, what if being dead actually helps him achieve his financial, fitness, and happiness goals? Perhaps our lawyers can work something out.

        IMPORTANT: Lawyers say that death would not count as achieving subject's goals. DO NOT LET SUBJECT DIE. To be fair, it's hard to do that when literally all you are breathing is life-preserving fluids.

        Subject woken up for health assessment. Subject seemed weak and disoriented. Subject whispered "Is it time?". Replied no. Subject winced in pain before returning to sleep. Rigorous mental wellbeing tests needs to be developed to assess subject's mental health. Development is unlikely due to budget constraints.

        Subject found curled in fetal position. Subject woken up. Subject mumbled words that do not correspond to words in any known language. Subject's language centres are likely to have shut down due to lack of use. Implement monthly mental therapy for future storage to prevent deterioration of various mental facilities. No signs of ageing detected. Immortality technically possible.

        The arctic wolf stirred in his sleep. Where was he? Floating. Somewhere. Pitch black. He grunted. And who was he? Something, someone. Nothing came to mind. Around him the world didn’t exist, and perhaps neither did he.
