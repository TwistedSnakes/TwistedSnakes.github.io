    <div id="story-form"><div class="story-container"><div class="story"><p class="title align-left">The Installment Plan</p><p class="subtitle align-left">Written by TwistedSnakes</p><p class="subtitle align-left">Commissioned by LTs94</p><div class="title-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Located in the Ashos state, the Silver Serpent Casino is one of the most highly-acclaimed casinos in the world, boasting over two hundred thousand visitors each day to its many casino games that filled its rooms. People gambled for high stakes, each game easily moving ten thousand dollars worth of credits between the gamblers. Only the rich could afford to play such extravagant games, although one could borrow money from its many in-house moneylenders and hope they got lucky.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>However, its secret to success was its kinky-themed aesthetics, drawing not just gamblers but also kinky people to its bondage rooms. Latex-clad butlers and maids would walk down its carpeted floors, handing out energy drinks and light refreshments to the casino's patrons. Living statues and displays lined the walls and hallways. Slaves and pets could be found strolling around the game room floor until the occasional patron clipped a leash on them and led them back to their hotel room built above the casino.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Perhaps it was the thrill of the risk. Perhaps it was the sexually-charged atmosphere. Or perhaps it was the fact that he was good at the games he played. Whatever the reason was, just four days ago Sulík found himself in the grand hallways of the Silver Serpent for the first time, dressed in a slim and form-fitting suit with a membership card in hand.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Today, however, he was on a winning streak as he laid down his hand on the poker table in front of the other players.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Straight," he said smugly. There were audible groans from the other players as they threw down their hands and the credits in their membership cards were drained into Sulík's. Some of them threw their cards down on the table and stormed away, only to be replaced by more gamblers as they took their seats. An orange-furred tigress dressed in a form-fitting and elegant dress was among them, sitting on the leather-lined seat with an air of royalty.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík looked around him. Three players on his left, and one more on his right with most of them new to the table. This will be an interesting game. Dressed in his leather tuxedo, the dealer behind the table gathered the cards and slid them into a slot that appeared in the velvet tabletop. There was a whirring sound as the cards were shuffled. More slots on the table appeared, dealing out two cards to each player and three on the table, and the ante of five hundred was deducted from each person's card.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was a second of silence as everyone peered at the cards on the table. An eight of hearts, four of spades, and a king of clubs.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Five hundred," the tigress on the left raised. There was a soft chime as the points were deducted. </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Call," the German Shepherd nodded. Another chime.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Raise. Hundred," the shark next to him stated with a blank expression. Sulík glanced at him and the shark turned his head a little and the two made eye contact for a second.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A poker face. A good try, but not good enough.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a smirk, Sulík slammed his palm on the table. "A thousand," he raised.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was an audible groan from the table.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fold," the buck his right backed out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The shark folded too, leaving him behind with the tigress and German Shepherd. They finished the first round of betting and another card slid out of the slot in the table. Five of diamonds.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Another round of betting. The tigress raised the pot with another three hundred, which Sulík called. With a grunt, the canine folded. Sulík called.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>One last card slid out on the table. A two of spades.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The side of Sulík's lip twitched and his brow furrowed, but he quickly caught himself. He looked up to see the tigress studying him intently. He forced a grin at her and focused on his cards.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Raised. Seven hundred," she grinned smugly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The German Shepherd groaned and folded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Four hundred," Sulík raised.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The tigress snorted. "What are you trying to do?" she taunted. "I read you like a book. Three thousand," she raised.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík grunted as he called.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The tigress set her cards down on the table. Two fives, a spade and a heart. "Three of a kind," she smirked.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A grin appeared from the side of Sulík's lips. "Straight," he declared as he put down a six of hearts and a seven of clubs.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What the-," the tigress gasped in surprise. She grabbed her membership card off the table as the points were deducted, got off the stool and stormed off in meaningful strides as a rubber-suited slave followed behind her.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík laughed under his breath as another player took her place. Amateurs.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík sauntered down the carpeted floors of the hotel as his fingers fiddled with the keychain that held his casino membership card that functioned as an identification card, casino gaming card, and the hotel keycard all at once. The soft and dim glow of the blue chandeliers reflected off his brown plated body and horns, revealing his draconic form as he casually swung his tail behind him as he walked.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Another person was strutting swiftly down the corridor towards him. A streak of orange. The figure bumped into him as he walked past and he dropped his keychain to the ground. With a nimble swing, he grabbed the person's wrists, stopped the person in their tracks.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What's the hurry?" he cooed. Under the light of the overhead lights, the tigress glared back at him. "Ahh...you," he grinned.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Unhand me, lizard," the tigress snapped.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hmm? But we've only just met properly," he turned to face her and pulled her closer. "And I'm a lekta, not a lizard."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So you're only a half dragon," she smirked. "Now, unhand me," she repeated.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík grunted. "Don't talk about my people like that," he snapped.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh, I seem to have hit a nerve," she taunted. "Why? Not proud of your dirty blood?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The lekta raised her wrist up over her head and pushed her to the wall, pinning her there.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Get off me, mutt! Security? Security!" she cried out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Three uniformed guards came running down the corridor to the source of the streams, separating the tigress and lekta, holding the latter in a hammerlock hold. Sulík winced in pain. "I'm not hurting anyone," he grunted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Guards," the tigress lamented with a tone of faux distress. "This lizard tried to drag me into his hotel room. I was so afraid he'd rape me."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Don't worry ma'am, you're safe now," the guard tending to her comforted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I did not!" Sulík objected and struggled, "She's lying!" His arm was twisted further behind him and he stopped his protesting.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"We shall be taking care of this, ma'am. Could you come up with us so we can take your statement?" the guard asked. The tigress nodded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"She's lying!" Sulík grunted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And it's my word against yours," the tigress eyed him with a haughty gaze.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So what? Who are you anyway?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The tigress puffed out her chest and crossed her arms in front of her. "I'm Miss Kuji, Master Gambler of the Silver Serpent."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>In a dark office at the back of the Silver Serpent, Sulík found himself seated opposite a fur behind a sleek, modern desk. He was wearing a suit that was both functional yet smart, and from under the suit, his striped blue fur was showing. Above his head were two sharp horns and ears, completing his no-nonsense look. A tern. Another exotic fur, just like him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A recording of the events that happened in the hotel floors above the casino was playing on the computer monitor that faced the both of them. “So, let's hear what you have to say about this," the tern said.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I wasn't going to rape her," Sulík insisted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And I believe you," the tern assured him. Sulík was taken aback. Hmm. He took a closer look at the tern sitting in front of him. Above his right breast pocket was name tag that read "Javek, Head of Operations".</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"But to be of any help to you, I'll need to know more," Javek carried on. "So, what happened?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, she was going really quickly and bumped into me, which I figured was rude," Sulík shrugged. "And so I wanted an apology."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The tern nodded in response, prompting Sulík to carry on. "And it turned out that she was the person I beat in an earlier game, so I just wanted to say hi, you know what I mean?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So what's this about the rape accusations?" the tern tilted his head, trying to work things out. "He mustn't be too bright, for him not to be able to put two and two together," Sulík thought.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"She must've been bitter about her loss. What am I to say? I'm a good player," he boasted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah," Javek took a deep breath and sighed, absorbed in his thoughts. The few seconds of tense silence was broken when he finally opened his mouth to speak again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, you see, we have a dilemma here," he began. "On one hand, you claim innocence. On the other, we have another patron saying otherwise. Based on all the evidence we have here, things are not looking good for you," Javek admitted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"But I didn't do anything!" he protested.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I know you didn't," the tern said resignedly. "But now that we're here, we need to come to a resolution. With a case as serious as rape allegations, we could have a court situation on our hands."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík grunted. He hated to admit it, but the tern was right. He was in a tight situation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Is there any way you- I mean we, can fix it?" he asked.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, I have discussed with Miss Kuji about it before coming to talk to you. Luckily for us, she's open to settling this internally," he stated as he raised a brow in suggestion.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What do you mean?" Sulík furrowed his brow in response.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"It means, we can settle for compensation here, without news of this incident ever leaving the Silver Serpent."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So, what's the catch?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Nothing. We will work out a satisfactory compensation plan with Miss Kuji, and you either agree to it, or we bring it up to court".</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík thought for a moment. With his business and image that he had built around himself, he had too much of a reputation to risk a scandal like that.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fine, I'll do whatever you want," he rolled his eyes. "Whatever it takes to keep this from the public."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Very well," Javek nodded. "Glad we can come to an agreement. We'll need you to sign these forms before we begin." He took a brown paper folder off a tray on his desk and laid its contents out on the table. Contracts.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What are these?" Sulík peered at them wearily.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mere formality. Some non-disclosure agreements, stuff like that," the tern shrugged.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Let me call my lawyers," the lekta pulled out his phone. "They'd want to take a look at this before I put my name on anything."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah, you might not want to do that," the tern stopped him. "One, us settling this matter under the table isn't going to look well on us if your lawyers get a whiff of this. The Silver Serpent's reputation is at stake here, much like yours. Two, isn't the point of this method of settlement to keep this away from legal eyes?" He said the last question half as if a taunt, half as if a threat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík grunted. The tern was right. "Fine," he gave the contracts a cursory skim before signing his name on each page. "Let's settle this."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Javek nodded with a warm smile. "Thanks for your cooperation," he gathered the papers, lifting them on their sides to tap them on the table to make the edges align before he slid them neatly back into the envelope. "Please come with me, Mr Sulík," he got up and walked over to the office door and opened it, leading the way out with Sulík following behind.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The both of them walked down through the white-walled corridors that were behind the scenes in the casino. Compared to the dark and elegant feel to the public hallways of the casino, these corridors were minimalistic and sterile. One thing remained the same though: employees were leading pets and slaves down the corridor, wheeling bondage gear around on carts, and transporting wriggling statues around.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>They came to an unmarked rectangle that glowed against the wall. Javek stood in front of it and a column of light glowed about him. "Personnel Javek Feathertail detected. Access granted," a female robotic said calmly. The door faded away, revealing a white room inside.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The both of them stepped into the room, revealing a laboratory of some sort. The doorway faded into place behind them, leaving behind a smooth wall.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Where are we?" Sulík asked as he looked around. The ceiling was high and from it hung a lot of metal arms and cables. The clean walls were lined with shelves and cupboards that formed a countertop, on which were both surgical and hardware tools from tweezers to screwdrivers. Bondage gear like hoods and gags sat on some of the shelves, making the entire laboratory seem odd.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, this is one of our production labs where we prepare our various decorations for the casino. We have some experimental labs down the hallway for coming up with new forms of bondage, but we'll leave that for another time," Javek introduced.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And we're here because?" the lekta asked suspiciously.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'll explain in a bit," Javek crouched over a desk and tapped on the keyboard as a screen mounted on the wall lit up. "But for now, mind standing in the circle?" He tapped a key and a ring glowed in the middle of the room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík grunted but complied anyway. Suddenly a burst of electricity surged around him and coursed through his body. "Argh!" he crumpled to the ground kneeling. Metal bindings curved through the ground, securing his lower legs to the ground.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ngrr!" he barked at the tern. "What's this?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, let's just say I've already prearranged a suitable compensation plan with Miss Kuji," the tern walked in front of him and grinned. "We'll be keeping you here at the casino indefinitely."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Wait, what?" Sulík half asked, half shouted. "What do you mean? Damn it you said you believed me!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Between a master gambler of five years and a new patron of five days, I think her word holds more water, don't you think?" the tern thought out loud. "Which makes you a dangerous rapist and sociopathic liar. Very dangerous to not just the patrons of the Silver Serpent, but also society at large."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Why you dirty-" he took a swipe of his claws at Javek, who caught it with one hand. Two metal cylinders descended from the ceiling above Sulík, opening up lengthwise to reveal its rubber-padded insides. Holding Sulík's wrist in a tight grip, Javek pulled his arm over his head and pinned his forearm inside the cylinder and closed the two halves together. There was a click as the metal barrel locked into place, trapping his arm there.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ngrr!" he growled. "What are you doing to me?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The end-goal is indefinite storage, but we got to prepare you for that," the tern explained. "You know, break you down and all."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík took another swipe at Javek with his free arm, catching him off guard. The tern winced and stumbled backwards as blood seeped out from under the fur on his calf. Another round of electricity shocked Sulík and he shuddered in pain. Before he could recover, Javek raised his other arm and clamped it inside the next cylinder.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Nice try," the tern grunted, glaring angrily at Sulík as he nursed his leg. "I'll make sure you never get out of your storage."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Don't you dare!" Sulík seethed. The tern grabbed him by the chin and pulled him face to face with his icy stare. "Try me," Javek threatened.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The lekta shot a dirty look back at Javek. But there was nothing else he could do so he settled for a hostile growl at his captor.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Satisfied that the lekta was fully secured, Javek limped over to a cupboard, searching through some metallic equipment before finally taking out a triangular metal plate and limping back to Sulík. His claws dug into the lekta's suit and with a swift movement, his shirt was torn down the middle and ripped off him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gah! What are you doing?" he protested.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Taking off your clothes," Javek shrugged and shredded Sulík's pants and underwear too, rendering him nude. The metal plate was pressed against the lekta's crotch where its suction cups attached itself to his scales.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The device began warming up, heating his nether regions. "What's this?" the lekta demanded. There was a buzzing sound as the metal codpiece began vibrating, stimulating him against his will.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ehh?" he gasped in surprise. "H-hey!" Javek stood by watching him, ignoring his cries.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He could feel a tingly feeling near his crotch. But no! He can't be exposing his dicks. Not like this. However, this was outside of his control, and his primal responses trumped his laws of logic. His two fleshy members slowly poked their way out of the slit, one above the other, pressing against the padded walls of the codpiece as it trapped them inside.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gnrr..." he groaned. This was embarrassing. "S-stop..."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Stop?" the tern tilted his head and grinned. "But we've only just started." He took off the metal plate and placed it on the countertop as the two turgid cocks flopped out, half-hard from the vibrations.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Javek smiled as he extended the claw of his index finger, sliding it down the ribbed bottom of each of Sulík's dicks. Sulík let out a soft gasp of pleasure as he struggled against the metal bindings. "Ngr, my lawyers will have your head," he threatened.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The tern ignored him and gave the dicks a flick of his claws, making Sulík twitch in pain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Limping to another cupboard, Javek took a few more pieces of equipment down and placed them on a wheeled table. Two tubes, one muzzle, and a remote control. He tapped the buttons on the remote control and there was a collective beep as the other devices were synced together.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The table was wheeled back to the centre in front of the lekta. Javek picked up the muzzle brought it towards Sulík. He could see the muzzle, made out of a rubber base with black metal plates that gave it a futuristic look.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Get that away from me!" he protested as he turned his head away. However, he didn't have much room to escape to as the muzzle was forced over him and buckled into place, clamping his maw shut.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mffrtt!" he complained.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Javek picked up the two metal tubes on the table. More cylinders made of metal, except for a tight rubber ring on one end that led to its thick rubber linings. One after the other, Javek slipped each of them on one of Sulík's two dicks, firmly pushing it onto his stiff members.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a tap of the remote button, the tubes began vibrating, kneading his dick in strong and firm motions. "Ngnn!" he struggled against his binds as he looked at Javek threateningly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Javek had already gone to grab a roll of bandages from a first-aid box mounted on the wall. Collapsing weakly into a chair, he bound his wounds tightly. His blood seeped out and made a red stain on his bandages but at least he wasn't dripping his blood all over the floor anymore.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík, however, wasn't getting relief. Instead, he was getting aroused against his will, involuntarily thrusting his hips in the air as his two dicks throbbed in their metal prisons.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Do not cum," a metallic voice called out from above him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He grunted. He wasn't intending to anyway. But the vibrations continued as the tubes milked his two penises. He shuddered as the erotic sensations coursed through his body. Pushed towards the edge. No. He needed to hold it in. He winced as he tried to hold himself back, struggling against his thirsty libido that wanted release. He shook his head. He couldn't hold it in anymore. He rocked his hips as his seed shot out from both his dicks and into the tubes. He felt his warm seed spread over the front of his dicks before the tubes sucked it all up.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Unauthorized cumming detected," the voice reprimanded. The muzzle Sulík was wearing suddenly closed its nose holes and he found his supply of fresh air cut. His metal bindings emitted mild electrical shock and he struggled, trying to bend over but stopped by his arm restraints.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ngnnn!" he struggled as the machine punished him. He needed air but the muzzle was giving him no relief.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Needed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Air.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The electrocution subsided and nose holes in the muzzle opened up. He took a deep breath and panted, glaring at the tern with all the fury he could muster as fresh oxygen filled his lungs. Noticing his scowl, Javek smiled back and patted the lekta's head.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Good dragon," he purred. "Now, you be a good boy and follow instructions, alright?" Javek got up and stood in front of the door. A column of light glowed as it detected the tern and the doorway opened. He disappeared out the door as it faded back into place, leaving Sulík alone in the room, trapped in the devious device.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The stimulations resumed as the tubes massaged his two throbbing members. But he wouldn't cum this time. He had his dignity. He had self-control. He could beat the machine.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But he was slowly humping the air.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Pushed to the edge.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Vibration.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Stroking.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Do not cum," the voice repeated.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfttt!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Just. This. Once.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Letting out a huge moan from behind his muzzle, he thrust his cocks forward, closing his eyes as he felt his pubococcygeus muscles squeeze out every last drop of his semen into the tubes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a click, the muzzle shut off the flow of air to his lungs and subjected him to repeated shocks again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"NGGRRRH!"</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík groaned as Javek appeared before him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"How was your night?" the tern asked with a taunting tone. Had it only been one night? It felt like he had been here forever, suppressing his orgasms the best he could before the inevitable happened.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík looked up angrily but tiredly at the tern. He wanted to growl too but his dicks were sore from the ordeal and he would take any chance to get out. Even if it means appeasing the tern. His expression turned to one of defeat and he looked pleadingly at Javek.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ready to get out?" the tern asked. Sulík nodded reluctantly, and Javek unbuckled the muzzle, placing it back on the table. The fresh air felt cool on his scales; a brief respite before the next step in his "compensation plan". The two cock-tubes were also taken off, exposing his two shafts of throbbing pink flesh </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The lekta slumped over, held up only by the metal clamps on his arms. He was tired. Drained. Worn out. </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Not that Javek cared. Going over to the computer terminal, the blue tern bent over the keyboard and typed into it. There was a whirring sound as Sulík's lower legs were released and arms were slowly raised towards the ceiling. Slouched over from fatigue, he was pulled to his feet until he was supporting his body weight with the tip of his toes. But the metal clamps didn't stop their ascent. He was raised higher until his body was hanging by his arms and he feebly kicked his feet in protest.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ngn..." he groaned weakly. "Let me go, I didn't do anything," he pleaded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ahh, too late for that," Javek tilted his head with an amused grin. "The preparations for your storage are complete."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What storage?" Sulík grunted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The permanent kind," the tern shrugged. "Weren't you listening? Anyway..." he tapped a button on the terminal and a small hole opened up on the ground between his legs. A metal pole with a ribbed dildo rose out of it, advancing threateningly on his bare ass.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"H-hey! What's this?" he kicked his legs in panic.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Neither the pole nor the tern responded to his question. Instead, the dildo nudged its cold tip against his tailhole as he struggled. He squeezed his tailhole tight as the plug pushed him upwards and body weight pulled him down. He was fighting against gravity. And he was losing. With a moan, the tip pushed its way past his sphincter.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík could feel the cold metal touch his insides, slowly sliding its ridges against his rectum as it forced its way in. Another arm with two convoluted metal clamps lowered from the ceiling towards his face. The lekta turned his head away from the clamps but the arm only followed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Stop this right now!" he demanded, but the fatigue of the milking and the apprehension of the situation made his plea come out as a helpless whimper. The clamps gripped his upper and lower maw and pulled his head towards the ceiling, forcing his field of vision upwards. They pried his jaws apart to the point of discomfort, revealing his sharp teeth and long tongue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Aghh rughh!" he protested. Another matching pole descended from the ceiling towards his open maw. "Hngg?" he gasped in surprise as his eyes widened in fear. The pole's path would lead it straight down his throat, something he was not looking forward to.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He looked around and turned his eyes towards Javek pleadingly and he twitched helplessly against his bonds. The tern, however, seemed content with just watching the show as the pole entered his maw.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík's saliva coated the pole as it entered his mouth and pushed its way down his throat. "Hngggggggg!" he screamed in pain as his oesophagus was forced open with the metal, making it hard for him to breath. His breaths came out as soft wheezing as he gasped for air. Driven by instincts, he wanted to claw against his neck to get rid of the discomfort that he felt within. However, he was helpless to do anything apart from kicking his feet in the air.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dildo in his ass wasn't giving him any relief either. It twisted and forced its way further up his digestive tract, forcing open his intestinal tracts and straightening them against the smooth pole. He let out a high pitch whine of pain and fear as he felt his internals being moved around with the cold, hard metal, sliding through the tight flesh of his ass and into the rest of his insides.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The pole in his throat had also filled out his oesophagus, straightening out his back and turning his squirms into feeble shudders. He had stopped kicking his feet as he tensed his muscles, leaving only his clawed toes twitching and trembling.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The two poles made their way through his digestive system, meeting in his stomach. The two poles twisted in opposite directions as the two poles screwed into each other, forming a continuous tube through his body that ended at his mouth. The arm from the ceiling let go of the pole, leaving its end sticking out of his open maw. The clamps on his jaws released him and he closed his mouth around the metal tube.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It felt hard and smooth against his tongue as he tried to shift his mouth into a more comfortable position. Unfortunately, there was no give and he was left staring at the ceiling, unable to turn his head, unable to close his maw, only able to make his feeble pleas through strained whimperings as the metal pressed against his windpipe.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Javek reappeared in his limited field of vision with a sleek helmet. It was made of metal and rubber parts, forming a futuristic-looking helmet with a visor at the front. A hole was cut out of it where the mouth was supposed to be. The helmet was lowered around the lekta's head and he continued to stare at the ceiling through the dark, tinted visor. The hole in the helmet lined up with the pole in his mouth and Javek sealed the two together with an epoxy glue, binding the helmet and pole together in one long restraint.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The helmet was closed around his head, squeezing his head in a tight enclosure and muffling his whines, reducing them to a soft mumble that could barely be heard from anyone standing beside him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Suddenly, he could feel the warm fingers of the tern holding his upper dick with his clawed thumb and index finger. There was a piercing feeling at the tip of his dick as something was pushed down the tip of the urethra. He shuddered and twitched feebly and defenselessly as the insides of his shaft were invaded with the slippery and narrow tube, stretching him open. It pushed past his urethral sphincters and into his bladder where it inflated, leaving it stuck in him. A second tube went down his other dick in the same way, inflating at its tip, lodging in his bladder where it could drain any urine that he produced. Perfect for the long-term storage that he would soon be facing.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His arms were released, leaving him free to move. But the ordeal had drained all his energy and they slumped to his sides. He was now supported entirely by the long, hollow pole that resided in his body. His eyes flickered back and forth at the ceiling, looking at the various arms and wires through his visor.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Spread your arms and legs," he could hear the tern's voice through the speakers on each side of the helmet's internal walls. He didn't have any energy left to protest. Instead, he raised his arms and spread his limbs into a spread eagle position. Two rubber sheets mounted on rectangular frames closed in on him on the front and back, obscuring his vision as he was encased in a vacbed. A soft hum of a vacuum could be heard, and the rubber sealed itself around him. Sulík struggled against the rubber but each tug was only met with resistance and tension from the latex sheets.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He could feel a warm liquid ooze over him from under the rubber sheets. "Soft resin. A soft sealant," the tern's voice came through the helmet again. It slowly cooled around him, restricting his movement from under the sheets as the rubber stiffened around him. A flexible but firm prison for the rest of his life.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Beginning mental scrub," the tern's voice could be heard. The visor in front of lekta flickered to life as swirling and flashing patterns appeared before his eyes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You are nothing but an object," a cold voice spoke to him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Huh?" he thought.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Objects don't have freedom," the voice continued.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"But I'm not an object!" he protested in his head.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Objects don't have wills of their own," the words echoed through his mind.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ngn, I'm not an object," he tried to ignore the voice, replacing it with his own thoughts.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Objects don't have thoughts of their own," it drowned out his mental voice.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You are an object."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"No freedom."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"No will."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"No thoughts."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He could barely think from the barrage of words that assaulted his mind. He squirmed feebly from under the rubber that was sealed against his scales. He wasn't an object.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was Sulík.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A lekta.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was in the Silver Serpent.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Trying to.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Escape?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wait.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>What was he doing?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Uhh.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gnnn..." he moaned. He wasn't sure of the answers anymore.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Remaining free will: eighty percent," a voice could be heard from outside the vacbed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But his thoughts were slipping through the fingers of his mind.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He needed to. Pull himself together.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík. Lekta.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Silver...something. Some casino.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Remaining free will: sixty percent."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Free will? Sixty percent?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík. Lekta.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Casino.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Girl. Accusations.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>What happened?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Remaining free will: forty percent."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Gnnrr...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sulík. Half dragon.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Remaining free will: twenty percent."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Su...who was he?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Remaining free will: ten percent."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He needed to hold on. To something. Something he was holding on to. What was it? All he knew that it was being pulled out of his grasp. But what was it?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Was it important?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was getting pulled away. With one last tug, it slipped out of his hands, away from him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Remaining free will: zero percent."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Flashes and swirling patterns flashed before the lekta's glazed eyes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Ten years.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Ten years he had been restrained, encased, and sealed in his latex prison. Not that he could complain. Other than a soft buzzing of white noise, his mind was completely blank. Unable to hold process a single thought. Unable to make his own decisions.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was a sound of hissing from within the vertical vacbed. Fluids were spraying from tiny holes in the internal pole, coating his insides with a sticky liquid: a mixture of a nutrient solution and body preservatives, designed to extend his lifespan and in turn his indefinite sentence in storage.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The tubes in his urethra sucked up the liquids in his bladder, draining them away before they could accumulate. The entire system was designed to keep the contained subject in stasis for long-term storage. The extent of this duration was what they were intending to push to the limit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A female fox dressed in a lab coat walked over to the vertical structure with a vibrator wand in her hand. Turning it on, she pressed it against the crotch of the figure stuck in the vacbed. The figure's limbs trembled from under the rubber but the body remained straight and rigid. The two dicks throbbed and twitched, pressing against the head of the wand as it stroked the underside of the shafts.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The tension was building up. His hips still wanted to hump the space in front of him and he shifted uneasily, moving only as much as the pole allowed him to. The buzzing in his mind was replaced with a raw feeling of euphoria that filled his head. To cum. That was all he wanted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Just a bit more.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was close to the edge.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He thrust his two cocks forward and the metal pole held his insides in place. He could feel his intestines being stretched but the pain didn't matter. He wanted pleasure. He wanted release. He shot his load out as he made a final thrust.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His seed was sucked through the urethral tubes, milked and stored for future use. He slumped over weakly, enjoying the pleasure as the lab assistant continued massaging his cocks with the vibrator wand.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He would be here for the rest of his very, very long life.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Was this what he wanted?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He wouldn't know.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>All he could do is to hump in endless ecstasy.
