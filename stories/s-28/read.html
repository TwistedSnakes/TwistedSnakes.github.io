What could go wrong?", "summary": "Auro, after losing a lot of money from a mistaken bet at the Silver Serpent Casino, is forced to pay it off as a service staff. He's suited up in a Yveltal mecha suit and tasked to service other patrons in the Silver Serpent.\nWhen his working efficiency is insufficient to pay off his debt, Auro gets an upgraded Yveltal suit. This time, the suit comes to life, extending wires that grab Auro and pull him into the suit. A spinal attachment links him up to the suit, and a dildo is knotted in his rump. Another dildo is forced into his mouth, gagging him inside of the suit. The suit will allow him to work 24/7 now, increasing his efficiency. The suit also uses the spinal attachment to control Auro's body, further increasing the amount of work he can do. Completing tasks will also reward him with an orgasm, which force-feeds his seed back to him.\nBut the prolonged use of the mecha suit slowly wipes Auro's mind, until he's no more than a service drone in the Silver Serpent.", "commissioners": ["AuroVee"], "authors": ["TwistedSnakes"], "illustrators": [], "tags": ["setting - Silver Serpent", "male", "solo", "gay", "mecha", "suit", "living suit", "dronification", "transformation", "gag", "dildo gag", "stimulation", "teasing", "dildo", "anal plug", "cum circulation", "cum swallowing", "body takeover", "brainwash", "identity loss", "non-consent", "permanent", "bad end"], "display_tags": ["Setting - Silver Serpent", "Male - Solo", "Victim - Male human", "Mecha Yveltal suit", "Dronification", "Dildo gag", "Dildo anal plug", "Cum circulation", "Body takeover", "Brainwash", "Identity loss", "Non-consent", "Permanent", "Bad end"], "data": {}, "is_listed": true};

Sure, some casinos here and there may tout their high limits at their tables, but none of them come close to the Silver Serpent's games. Its patrons can expect to bet a few thousand or so at a game of Texas Hold 'Em, all the way to the high-end tables with a minimum bet of a million.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>While these high limits tend to chase customers away from most other casinos, it is precisely these limits that attracted the rich and famous to the Silver Serpent: a place where only the most dedicated of gamblers come to test the extents of their skills, the limits of the luck, and the depths of their pocket. The best of these gamblers would receive the title "Master Gambler" within the casino: a title that every high roller worth his or her keep would vie for.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Perhaps another aspect that drew people in was its bondage undertones. Most of their service staff consisted of rubber-clad maids, gas-masked drones, and chained-up slaves that patrolled the halls of the Silver Serpent as they tended to every whim of its patrons and guests.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Each section of the casino was decorated with a theme, from ancient Egypt to futuristic galaxies of outer space, changing every few months in a grandiose venture to surprise its patrons with fresh sights and sounds. The staff tending to that sector of the casino would also be dressed to the theme of the area, immersing its guests in a totally different world.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>One particular gambling hall of the Silver Serpent was currently decorated in a sky theme. Wisps of mist that resembled clouds billowed out from vents in the wall and covered the carpeted ground in a thin veil of fog. Among the gamblers walked avian anthros dressed in white rubber suits that clung to their bodies in the most revealing way possible, sporting either perky breasts or generous crotch bulges that immediately gave away the gender of the person within the suit. What was common among all of them were the white, translucent visors that covered the entirety of their faces and making one drone indistinguishable from the other.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Above all the drones and guests was a sphere that hung from the ceiling. It gave off an incredible amount of light in all directions, making it painful for anyone daring to stare directly at it. Mechanical arms moved it gently across the painted sky of the ceiling, simulating the sun's movement and shifting the shadows on the ground. As the sphere moved across the ceiling it gave the feeling of morning, noon, and evening, but never night as it would turn around and repeat its celestial path.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>In that sense, it was now "noon" in the gambling hall of the Silver Serpent. At one of the many tables sat a human named Auro, hunched intently over the roulette table. Something about this game always got him coming back here. Maybe it was the satisfying clack-clack-clack of the metal ball as it bounced around the spinning wheel. Or perhaps it was the thrill of suspense. Or possibly the feeling of being able to "see" and predict the next number that the ball would fall on. Not that he guessed right all the time but the fact that he had walked away from roulette tables each time with more credits than he had started with was proof enough for him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A moose dressed in a white tuxedo with feathered wings stood at the back of the table, taking the role of a dealer as he called for the next round of roulette. Holographic chips appeared on the table with a floating label that indicated the owner of the bet as well as the amount they bet. Auro watched silently; he saw no point in betting early when he could place his bet closer to when the ball would fall.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>After a few moments, the dealer pushed a button on the table and the roulette wheel in the middle began spinning as the motors beneath it worked the wheel in silence. A metal ball was released from a chute, sending it spinning on the wheel in the opposite direction of the wheel's rotation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Clack-clack-clack.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Auro watched the wheel intently. The number "26" seemed to flash before his eyes as it went around the wheel. He needed to bet on 26.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Betting closing in five," declared the dealer.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Aura hurriedly turned to an electronic touchscreen display on the table in front of him and tapped the "100" button.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Four."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He looked at the "26" square on the table's digital display but his bet didn't show up.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Three." Clack-clack-clack.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">What?</span><span> He looked at his control panel where a confirmation dialogue had popped up. "Are you sure you want to..."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Two." Clack-clack-clack. The wheel was slowing down.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Auro didn't read the entirety of the prompt. Why was this panel suddenly asking about his bet? It had never done that before.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"One."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He quickly tapped the "Yes" button and the dialogue disappeared.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Betting is closed."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>All there was left to do was to watch the ball come to rest on the decelerating wheel.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was a loud ping as a bet appeared in the table; a huge pile of holographic chips. "$100,000,000" read the label.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Whoa," Auro thought. "Who would bet so much on just one number?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The name above the number gave him his answer.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Auro"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Huh?! </span><span>He hurriedly turned to his screen where the unit of the button was set to "million" instead of "one". </span><span class="italic">Fuck!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He turned back to the wheel. His only hope was that the ball landed on 26. He couldn't afford a loss of a hundred million. His eyes followed the ball as it rolled across the wheel, passing over the numbers,</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>28.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>12.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>35.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>3.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>26.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But the ball still had momentum left.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>0.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>32.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It finally came to a halt at 15. Damn it!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Auro hid his face in his palms as the huge pile of chips on the table disintegrated and the other gamblers watched his downfall in morbid curiosity.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The human followed behind a blue-furred tern and a red fox as the group walked down the staff corridor of the Silver Serpent. Unlike the elaborately-designed corridors that its patrons walked through, the staff corridors were made of a </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>sleek and white panels and flooring, giving it a sterile and laboratory-like feel.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Anyway Calroz, we do get patrons every now and then who bet off a little more than they could chew," the tern explained, chuckling at his pun.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I see," the fox acknowledged.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Anyway, it's no loss to the Silver Serpent. We have a lot of job openings that they could help fill. Pay off their debts in a few years, easy," the tern looked at the clipboard at Auro's betting report. "Well, maybe not 'easy'," he corrected himself.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The tern stopped at one of the many glowing rectangles that lined both sides of the corridor's walls. The tern stood in front of the rectangle and a beam of light glowed around him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Personnel Javek Feathertail detected. Access granted," a female robotic voice announced. The rectangular panel faded away and the three of them stepped into the white room within. The panel faded back into place, isolating them in the room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>At first glance, the room seemed to be empty. However, the square panels that lined the walls had handles attached, indicating the presence of drawers built into the wall. On the opposite side of the room was a huge transparent window that revealed an adjacent room that was, too, empty. Another glowing rectangle formed a doorway between the two rooms.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mr Auro," Javek turned to the human, "You will be working at the Silver Serpent until all your debts are paid off. As part of the contract you signed, we will also be providing you with food and lodging free of charge. Is that understood?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Auro nodded awkwardly. "Understood," he muttered.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Good, now please step through the doorway into the other room," the tern pointed to the door and Auro complied. The human walked through the doorway and the rectangular panel materialized behind him, separating the two rooms.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So Calroz," Javek's voice came through the intercom from the other room, "Since we are a little low on spare mecha attendants, Mr Auro will be filling in that role for us. Tap your access pass on the grey panel."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Auro watched through the glass window as the fox followed the tern's instructions. A control panel slid out in front of the glass window awaiting the staffs' input.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Now, select the 'suits' category, and...yes, 'mecha'. Mmm, we could do with some more drones for the Pokémon wing."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The floor in the middle of Auro's room opened up and a robotic figure rose from it. With its sleek, metal plating that covered its humanoid form, it looked like a futuristic suit of armour as it stood in the middle of the room. Its eyes were black, tinted lenses and upon its head were two metal fins that pointed forward. Black vein-like patterns ran down its red and black armour plating and its arms seemed to widen into clawed wings.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"A Yveltal? Mmm, not a bad choice," Javek nodded, "Mr Auro, enter the suit if you will."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Enter the suit? How was he supposed to do that? Auro carefully stepped towards the Yveltal suit until he was face-to-face with the suit. With a hiss, the robotic suit opened up. Its chest spread open its armoured plates and the front half of the helmet lifted away. The underside of its arms and legs slid away to reveal its hollow limbs,</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Auro hesitated as he studied the inside of the suit. It was padded inside with a shiny, rubber-like cushion and metal contacts lined the spinal support, arms, and legs.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I apologize, Mr Auro, but I don't have all day," the tern stated flatly. "Please get into the suit."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The human nodded numbly before turning around and stepping back into the suit. The rubber padding pressed against his skin and clothes, creating a snug fit around his body. There was the whirring sound of rotating joints as the parts of the suit closed around him. The metal parts clamped together and the rubber mask of the helmet pressed against his face.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The lenses over his eyes glowed to life as its display showed him numbers and figures that reflected his vital signs.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I see you've noticed the display," Javek explained. "The Nexus will be assigning you tasks within the Silver Serpent hotel and casino, which it'll update on your display."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The Nexus, sir?" Calroz tilted his head.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah, my bad. The Nexus is the AI that manages the background operations of the Silver Serpent. Everything from your casino memberships to your hotel bookings, from slave production to accounting are all settled. It makes my job as Head of Operations easier," Javek bragged. "Anyway, you should be getting your first task as a service staff of the Silver Serpent right about now."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sure enough, the words "Attend to Master Gambler 'Eos Siberius'." showed up on his display. A map popped up, tracing the path from his current location to where the guest was.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Carry on with your tasks. I'd tell you that if you need help you should feel free to ask, but the Nexus should be able to answer all your questions before you even have them," Javek instructed," Is that understood?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The Yveltal mecha nodded stiffly before walking out of the room. The doors ahead of him opened automatically and not once did he need to stop. Glowing arrows on the ground pointed Auro in the right direction. If he didn't know any better, he could've sworn that the arrows were painted on the tiles rather than coming from the helmet's augmented reality display.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He exited the staff corridor and back into the carpeted hallways of the Silver Serpent. The arrows led him to a gambling room decorated to look like a Pokémon town, complete with a Pokémart and Pokémon centre. Painted trees and carpet grass gave the room the feeling of the outdoors. Drones fitted in Pokémon suits attended to the various guests in the room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Auro followed the arrows until his helmet projected a glowing outline around an otter dressed in a light blue cotton tank top, Bermuda shorts and flip-flops. The words "Eos Siberius" was floating over his head and the human could not help but feel amused at the discrepancy between the otter's physical appearance and how he imagined a Master Gambler to look like. The otter wasn't very scrawny. In fact, he was rather well-built. But a slim otter in an outfit that seemed more at home at the beach than at a high-stakes casino didn't quite fit the bill.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The otter noticed Auro standing by and his eyes brightened up.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah! Are you assigned to assist me today?" he smiled happily.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Auro nodded. "Yeah," he replied politely, his voice coming out like a vocal synthesizer created it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh good!" Eos nodded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The human started to realize that he had no clue as to what to do. Didn't service staff usually receive some sort of training to tell them how to treat guests? But before he could react his helmet pointed out the backpack that the otter was carrying and the words "Help carry bag." appeared over it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"May I help you with that?" Auro asked, reaching out his hand for the bag.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Huh?" the otter tilted his head. "Oh, no, no. It's fine. I just need someone to help me find my way around the casino. I always get lost somewhere," he smiled sheepishly before leaning over closer to Auro. "And frankly, between you and me, I'm afraid of someone wanting to beat me up. It's an irrational fear, I know. But I feel safer now with you as a bodyguard."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Eos stepped back and looked around. "Well, I feel like some Devil's Dice," he pondered out loud.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Directions to the Devil's Dice game room appeared on Auro's internal map. "Please come with me," he requested politely and the otter followed him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Hopefully, the otter would lose enough money to the Silver Serpent and expedite his full repayment.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"A hundred and fifty-seven thousand, two hundred and eighty-three dollars, and fifteen cents in two weeks," Calroz read off the clipboard to Auro who was wearing his employee uniform instead of the mecha outfit which he was usually sporting. The both of them were in one of the many white laboratories as before. "That would amount to twenty-four point three seven years with us. Taking a yearly interest rate of five per cent..." the fox double-checked the report with a sceptical look, "you'll be here forever."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I will try to work harder, Sir Calroz," the human bowed before Calroz.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Forever is a long time, Mr Auro," the fox responded coldly with an eyebrow raised.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'm sorry," Auro bowed again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You're going to have to work longer hours to pay it back. Double your workload and you'll be here for around thirteen and a half years," Calroz stated flatly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Double? I'm already working fifteen hours a day. Is any other way?" the human pleaded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Sell your body to us. We need test subjects for suit-body interactions," the fox recited.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And that would take...how long?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Sell. Meaning you're ours to own. Forever."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Whoa, wait. I can't do that!" Auro protested, "I'd work harder and longer hours, but how can I earn more?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fret not. The Silver Serpent has its ways," Calroz nodded. "To help you," he nonchalantly added, "Please step into the chamber."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Auro went into the second room and found himself once again looking at the fox through a huge glass window that separated the both of them. Calroz was working the control panel in smooth taps without hesitation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The doorway behind him faded away and Javek stepped in.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah, Calroz," the tern greeted cheerily. "All going smoothly I hope?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The fox nodded silently in response as the tern turned to the window.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh? Mr..." the tern scratched his claw against his chin and tried to recall the human's name.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Auro," Calroz finished.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Right, right. Nice to see you again," Javek waved his hand dismissively before turning to the fox. "I assume he's not performing at optimal levels?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The fox nodded again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Very well then. I trust your judgement," the tern commented as he watched the fox update settings on the control panel.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Please remove all articles of clothings and deposit them into the chute," Calroz instructed as a panel slid open, revealing an empty receptacle. Auro complied and stood naked in the room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Calroz tapped another button on the control panel and with a hissing sound, the Yveltal suit emerged from the ground like before. This time, Auro had a bad feeling about the suit. Something about the mecha's eyes made it seem a little more sinister than before.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What are you waiting for?" Calroz prompted impatiently.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a gulp, Auro slowly approached the suit. Without warning, the suit sprung to life and lunged for the human who reflexively stepped backwards in surprise, tripping over and landing on the ground. Auro quickly scrambled away from the advancing mecha towards the side of the room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Help!" he shouted but Javek and Calroz only watched with mild interest and indifference respectively. The suit continued chasing him as he scrambled to the corner, catching up and grabbing him from the back. Its wings wrapped around his waist and its chest panels opened up.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wires from within the suit reached out and grabbed his body and limbs, pulling them into the hollow suit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hey! Let me go!" he protested as he thrashed about. He pulled himself free of some of the snaking cables as he squirmed, trying to escape the overpowering suit. The suit only continued with increased fervour and forced itself onto him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He tried to swing his upper arm behind to hit the mecha but its metal body felt no pain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oww!" he groaned but there was no time to nurse his injury. Instead, he continued to twist and turn on the floor as the mecha suit slowly but surely pulled him in. Its legs wrapped around his and metal clamps within them shut tightly around his calves, knees and thighs. The metal bit into his flesh and he winced in pain. The metal contacts pressed firmly against his skin as the rest of the armour closed around his lower body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Was this what the two of them had in mind from the start?</span><span> He didn't want to think about it. But considering the other option was giving himself up as the Silver Serpent's property.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The suit started pulling his arms and chest into the waiting chassis. Cables wrapped around his chest and yanked him into the rubber cushion. The helmet opened up and closed in around his head, forcing his view into the familiar two lenses that he had been seeing almost every waking hour.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>More metal clamps and contacts gripped his body and he winced in pain. The back column of the suit pressed against his spinal cord and he could feel needles poke through his skin, piercing his nerves. There was a sensation of something prodding his back door, forcing its way in.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah!" Auro gasped in surprise, tensing up his muscles as he tried to stop the intruder. The lubed probe, however, easily slid past his defences, lodging itself deeply within him. He could feel the firm surface of the plug against his muscles that tapered off at the end like an animal dildo. Suddenly, there was a swelling sensation at the base of the plug as it pressed against the inside of his anal entrance as if it was knotting him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hnng...what are you-mfft!" the human was suddenly interrupted as another similarly-shaped dildo was forced into his mouth, gagging him. Auro's hands clawed at his face as he tried in vain to pry the dildo out of his mouth as the sleek metal plates of the helmet secured it within him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Gnngh!" he groaned. There was nothing else he could do and the two operational staff of the Silver Serpent were not paying any heed to his predicament. Under the metal armour around his crotch, a rubber-padded tube encased his dick, giving it a gentle squeeze as it did so.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mmmg..." Auro moaned. He was getting turned on from the restrictive cock sleeve but the presence of others made him feel embarrassed as he did so.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"That will be your life support system. You will be in the suit twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, working until you pay off your debt," Calroz stated with a bored tone in this voice.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hmfft?" Auro exclaimed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So, you'll find the suit a little more... 'secure' to make sure nothing shifts out of place," the fox ignored his protests and carried on with his explanation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft ghnrft!" he pleaded through the gag.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And yes, don't worry about sleep, the mecha will manage that. It will help stimulate your body should you need an energy boost. On top of that, it will give you additional speed and strength to carry out your daily tasks better. We project that you'll be able to make easily fifty thousand daily. That should give you about...five and a half years with us."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hngg..." Auro begged, still kneeling on the ground.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Stop griping. Stand up now," the fox demanded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Before Auro could respond, his body pulled him to his feet.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Grwr?!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"About that. The suit will help you be a more obedient attendant. Optimal efficiency," Calroz explained, "There's also an inbuilt task and reward system. Let me demonstrate."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a tap on the control panel, a knee-height box rose out of the ground. "Pick up the cube," a mechanical voice spoke in his mind.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Huh? Was the suit talking directly into his brain? Was that what the spinal attachment was for?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But there was no time to think: his body was already walking towards the cube. He crouched down and picked it up. Almost immediately, a firm stroking sensation began massaging his cock in the most intense way Auro could imagine.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A strong and sweet-smelling aphrodisiac was pumped into the mask, forcing him to breathe it in. Within half a minute, he was trying to thrust his hips from within the suit. With a loud moan from behind the dildo gag, he shot his seed into the sleeve. There was a sucking sensation as the suit drained his cum. As Auro caught his breath, a sticky fluid was pumped through the hollow gag in his mouth. It tasted sweet, almost like the suit was feeding him...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Cum?! Was he being fed his own cum?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The smirk from the fox only confirmed his suspicions. Auro could not stand it anymore. What did he do to deserve this? Surely a tiny mistake shouldn't have earned him such a terrible punishment.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Yet there was no way out. He whimpered sadly from within the mask.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Enough. You have a lot of work to do, so get on with it," Calroz ordered sternly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yes, sir," a mechanical voice spoke in place of Auro and the Yveltal mecha began walking to the doorway as it faded open. He was halfway out of the lab before the fox spoke up again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"One more thing. As you would have noticed, the mecha suit uses a form of mind link to communicate with you. Over time, it will slowly train you to be more efficient with your duties," Calroz explained.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The mecha tilted its head to one side as if to indicate it was listening.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"In other words, the suit will slowly overwrite your mind. I daresay you have about three years to pay it off. But I recommend finishing your repayments as early as possible. The longer you're in there...well, the less of you will be left," the fox seemed indifferent to his plight. "Carry on, you're running out of time."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The Yveltal drone exited the room, striding down the corridor with a hurried pace. Calroz turned to Javek who had been standing by in silence.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, what do you think?" he asked.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Very good," the tern nodded in approval, "Efficiency is important. The Silver Serpent should run like clockwork."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I hope Mr Auro gets used to the suit. At this rate, he practically owns the suit," the fox thought out loud.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Technically, the suit owns him now," Javek corrected. "Anyway, enough chit-chat. We have work of our own too."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Calroz pondered for a second before nodding. The two of them headed out of the labs and went on their separate ways, each tending to more patrons of the Silver Serpent.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Five years later...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A Yveltal mecha was striding down the posh corridors of the Silver Serpent hotel when a couple stopped him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Excuse me, where can I find the 'Rocking Boat Restaurant'?" the male tiger asked.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Down the corridor, turn left to the lift lobby. Take the elevator down to the second floor, and the restaurant will be on your right," the drone responded in a robotic voice.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Alright, thanks!" the male shark of the couple smiled as they carried on their way.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>According to the Nexus, the drone had generated enough revenue to pay back its debts. Not that it seemed to notice. After Calroz had informed him of the completion of the debts, the Yveltal only nodded and went back to work.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The Silver Serpent would continue to run smoothly for many years to come, operating on the backs of its dedicated and efficient drones, of which Auro, now known as "Yveltal Drone 9F2AE" would remain one of for just as long.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ End ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
