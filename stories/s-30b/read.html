        Midnights in the urban city of Deonde were deceptively quiet. Under the thin veil of serenity, citizens would curl up in bed and huddle under their blankets, hoping that the occasional screams of terror belonged to someone they didn't know.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        An arctic wolf was among the fearful. However, instead of hiding in the safe shelter of his home, he was striding purposefully down the city's dirty streets. The light of the full moon reflected off his white fur and highlighted the intricate blue markings of his fur. Dressed in a grey sleeveless hoodie and black cargo pants, he blended in with the darkness of the city corners as he turned down an alley.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        His path led him to an enclosed clearing surrounded by the brick walls of the connected buildings. Windows were built into the walls three floors off the ground as if to escape the reach of the graffiti that covered the walls below, each gang symbol overlapping the one below it in open defiance.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        At the far end of the clearing was a stack of wooden crates that acted as a raised seat for the lizard that was sitting on it, hunched over his knees as he watched the approaching wolf. Surrounding him were three more gruff-looking canines that glared at him. All of them had one thing in common: a red scarf with a dragon marking that was tied around their left forearms: the symbol of membership to the underground and extensive gang of the Vialous.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Kazuki Tirashira," the lizard announced as the wolf stepped into the centre of the brick enclosure.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Scarface," the wolf replied, realizing that he only knew the lizard by an alias, "I have the money here. After this, you never speak a word of it ever again and it's like we never met."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Scarface pushed himself off the crates and landed with a heavy thud on the ground. With menacing steps, he strode up to Kazuki and smirked at him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Well, that was the plan, until..." Scarface trailed off as he waited to see the wolf's reaction.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Until what?" Kazuki demanded annoyedly.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Until I realized it's actually quite hard to keep a secret, you know?" the lizard almost seemed to savour the air in anticipation. The other gang members joined him in his grin, shuffling from foot to foot with their arms crossed.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Your point?" the wolf sneered, trying to hide his fear behind a glare of suspicion.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "My point is, ten thousand doesn't quite cover the cost of my silence," Scarface's lips pulled into a malicious grin, stretching the scar that started below his eye and ran down the side of his jaw and all the way to his chin. "My prices have increased. Fifty thousand."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "We had a deal," the wolf stated flatly. Could the lizard sense the fear he was trying to hide? Kazuki hoped for the best.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "There is no deal other than the one we're making now. Take it or leave it."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki hesitated. "I... can't afford that much."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Oh dear, I guess by the end of tomorrow, everyone on the streets will know the deepest..." the lizard paused as the air hung heavy between them.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Darkest..." he continued. Kazuki tried to hold his glare.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Secret," he finished and broke into a wide grin. The wolf looked away nervously.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "But, I can't afford that much," he pleaded earnestly.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Then the deal is off. It's of no loss to me," Scarface scoffed and pushed past Kazuki, knocking shoulders with him as he made for the alley exit. "Come, boys," he raised his palm up in the air, "We're headed home."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The gang members walked out of the alley and the shadows of the buildings slowly swallowed them up.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Wait!"

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        They paused in their tracks.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "I'll join you," Kazuki pleaded helplessly.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Leaving the other gang members behind, Scarface approached the arctic wolf.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Join us?" he scoffed.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "I'll join you. Until my debts are all paid back," the wolf gulped. He knew of the many evil deeds the Vialous gang were capable of, but he didn't have a choice. He looked up at the haughty and scarred face of the lizard.

        The city of Deonde stood in solidarity with the dead of the night. The pouring rain fervently bashed itself against the concrete walls and pavements of the urban landscape, as if desperate to cleanse the city of its filth. The water streamed down the sloped roads, dragging with it the dirt of the pavements and washing away the dried urine of the homeless.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Above the rooftops of the city sat a black cat. Matching his fur was a black jacket and leather pants, all of it getting drenched in the heavy downpour from the heavens. He gazed upon the city below with a sense of righteous anger. While the rain purged the dirt of the streets, it did nothing to clean out the city of its vile people. Gangs and thugs that would roam its streets would find shelter from the rain, refusing to have their sins washed away.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Not that Tyrian was in a position to say anything. He was too among the criminals of Deonde. "Not by choice," he would tell himself. But then again, who would turn to a life of crime if their conditions allowed them to live an innocent life, safe and free from the evil underground?
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Tyrian was definitely far from free and innocent. Tonight, he would do a dastardly deed, and once again he would get away scot-free. He had been watching his target for the past two weeks. He had watched his target wake up. Go to work. Go for meals. Go to sleep. He knew his target's habits like the back of his hand. And tonight he would put an end to it.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        His target's apartment was adjacent to the one Tyrian was perched on. The apartment lights had been turned off for two hours now and it was time for him to make his move. Tyrian stepped back from the ledge until he was a distance from it. Then with a running start, he leapt off the room and sailed across the gap between the two buildings.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Time seemed to slow for Tyrian as the rain splattered against his body. The opposite ledge was approaching him and he crouched in anticipation. His feet landed on the ground and he transferred his forward momentum into a roll before smoothly jumping to his feet. He made his way back to the ledge where a fire escape was positioned outside the window of the storey below.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        His motions were quick and purposeful. He lowered himself off the ledge of the building and landed softly on the metal platform of the fire escape. The metal shivered silently from the impact but the sound of pouring rain drowned all other sounds out. He swiftly made his way down the stairs until he was level with a familiar window.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Tyrian forced a sharp nail under the rickety window until he could feel a metal latch beneath the two beams of wood. Slowly and quietly he forced the latch to the side and gradually opened the window partway so that the sudden increase in volume of the downpour did not wake the apartment's sleeping inhabitant.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Making sure that the living room was empty, he cautiously climbed in, dripping rainwater all over the carpet. Furniture was neatly arranged around the room, decorated with laced cloths that draped across the couches and tables. In the middle of each table was a vase with a single rose. A mantlepiece over the faux fireplace sported picture frames of a husky couple from various vacations. Three doors led into other rooms and a passage led off into the adjacent kitchen.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Mrs Nordia was on yet another vacation with some friends, leaving Mr Nordia alone at home. Tyrian stepped towards the half-open doorway on the left. Mrs Nordia would not come home to a happy sight.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        He peered into the bedroom and saw a bundle of pillows and blankets. Just a quick slit of the throat and his job would be finished. He pulled out a sharp dagger from a sheath that was hanging from his belt as stepped towards the bed, grabbing the edge of the blanket. With a sharp jerk, he pulled the blanket off the bed.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Who are you?" demanded a voice behind him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Tyrian turned around with his dagger raised defensively in front of him. Facing him was a surprised husky standing in his nightclothes with a glass of water. Mr Nordia. Tyrian reacted quickly and strode towards the husky.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Mr Nordia stepped backwards in surprise and dropped his glass which shattered on the carpet, spilling water everywhere. The cat, however, did not stop. The husky, suddenly aware of the mortal danger he was in, hastily turned around and ran into the living room. His shaky fingers fiddled the lock and tried to get it open.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Hel-" he tried to call out but the cat was too fast. A black and wet arm grabbed his mouth from behind and silenced him. He flailed his arms behind him in a desperate attempt to fight off his attacker and he twisted himself out of Tyrian's grasp before throwing a punch back at him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Tyrian dodged the flying fist and threw a punch of his own against Mr Nordia. The husky flew backwards and landed on the coffee table and it smashed into splinters. There was no time for him though, and he hurriedly scrambled to his feet and back into the bedroom where he shut and locked the door.

        The window. The husky ran for the window and lifted it open.

        "Help!" he yelled again, louder this time. He turned around to look at the door. It was still locked but nobody was banging on it. Was his attacker still after him? He fumbled for the dresser and picked up the phone. His shaky fingers dialled "911" and he put the receiver to his ear as he turned back to the door.

        The shadow on the wall behind Mr Nordia, however, was shifting. A part of it rose out of the wall, solidifying into a dagger-armed fist as it separated itself from the wall. The rest of Tyrian emerged from the shadows and stepped towards the unsuspecting husky.

        A swift yank of his left hand around Mr Nordia's head and a slash of the blade against his neck and the job was finished. The phone dropped and hung from the dresser by its twisted cord and the husky slumped to the ground. Blood started to spread outwards from the carpet, darkening its beige woolly fabric with a dark, rich crimson.

        Blood on the carpet mixed in with the rain that poured in from the open window. But no matter how much the rain poured, it wouldn't be enough to wash off the blood. Tyrian stood over the husky as he coldly inspected the scene.

        The next shipment of drugs would be coming in soon. The white wolf's watch told him it was ten minutes to three in the morning when the coastal guards were changing shifts at the guard outpost. The perfect window of time to smuggle a shipment of drugs.

        Sure enough, a silent shape was coming over from the horizon. Painted black, it could barely be seen as it slowly approached the shore, its quickly-dissipating wake the only evidence of its presence. The motorboat made its way to the rocky shore where Kazuki and the rest of the gang were crouched behind the large boulders that littered the gravelly ground.

        A firm palm landed on his shoulder, giving him a reassuring squeeze. Kazuki turned up to see the scarred face of a lizard.

        "You ready for this, Bolt?" the lizard grinned. Bolt. The alias he was to be known by to all the other members of the gang. He shrugged off the lizard's hand.

        The boat pulled up close to the rocky shore and the lizard waved his hand, signalling the others to advance. Kazuki followed them, moving swiftly across the gravel until he was at the boat. A masked person on the boat grabbed a heavy duffle bag and tossed it at the arctic wolf who caught it with a loud huff. Two more bags were assigned to two more gang members and the rest of them held up their guns in a high alert stance.

        Kazuki led the party back up the shore towards the escape vehicle: an unmarked van parked on the road near the shore. The road stretched both ways from the left to the right, and behind it was a forest edge that led into the rest of the mainland.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        Seeing the van, the wolf picked up his pace. Twelve more trips and he'd pay off his debts. It wasn't going to be easy, but if he could keep this up, he'd get to be free of the Vialous' blackmail. He'd stay on the right side of the law and pretend that none of this ever happened.

        Suddenly, a bright searchlight from among the trees shone straight at him, illuminating the entire beach with its glow. Kazuki instinctively turned away and squinted his eyes from the glare.

        The lizard turned around and faced the police. The darkness of the night seemed to swirl around him and the large rocky slabs rose out of the ground, shielding them from the police fire. The gang members that had their hands free the turned around and fired back at the police, pinning some of them behind their covers and preventing them from firing.

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Bolt! Pass the goods!" he ordered. Kazuki tossed the bag to the lizard. The lizard grabbed it and continued his speedy pace back to the boat. The fifty metres it took to reach the shore felt like a thousand. The other gang's gunners continued their retreat, turning around only to pin the policemen down as they tried to advance on them.

        Kazuki pulled a pistol from his waist. Charging it up with his innate lightning power, he fired it at one a standing slab of rock where a few police officers had taken cover. Energized with an electric field, it struck the rock, blowing it up and sending the hiding attackers flying back. Kazuki turned back around and continued running.

        Despite the load, the lizard had already made it back to the motorboat, dumping the duffle bag onto its deck before hopping on it himself. The other gang members were catching up with him, Kazuki included.

        "I'm sorry," the lizard said, his voice barely louder than a whisper in the sound of the gunshots. But Kazuki could see read his lips, and his apology rang louder through his head than the sound of everything else. He tried to struggle to his feet but the pain made him gasp and his arms gave way again, letting gravity pull him back to the ground.

        Dressed in a business suit, Tyrian stepped through the glass doors of the Primsoar Corp office building and examined the lobby. At one in the morning, the office lobby was understandably deserted. The only other soul in the lobby was a bored-looking eagle seated behind the monitor of a security checkpoint.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Evening," the eagle's eyes brightened up at the prospect of company.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Tyrian, however, was never in a mood for idle talk. He nodded his head and placed his briefcase on the conveyor belt that pulled it into the X-ray machine. There were four metal detectors that stood in a row and Tyrian made for the second one from the right.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        He knew the guard wouldn't find any weapons in his briefcase. After all, everything he needed was on him. The metal detector he was going through was already sabotaged two nights before, making sure that it would not ring when he passed through it. He strode to the other end of the X-ray machine where his briefcase was waiting for him.

        "Guess I'll see you," the eagle shrugged dispiritedly as the black cat made for the elevators. Tyrian reached into his pocket, pulled out an employee ID card and tapped it on the gantry in front of the elevator lobby. The gantry opened up to let him in and the automated elevator nearest to him opened its doors.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The elevator doors closed behind Tyrian stepped into it. It accelerated upwards, beginning its swift ascent to the forty-third floor. Within half a minute, its doors were open again and Tyrian strode into the office corridor.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The carpeted corridor was lined with office cubicles and potted indoor plants. The smell of cheap air fresheners hung in the corridor, threatening to assault the nostrils of anyone passing through it. As expected, the corridor was empty as Tyrian strode through the building. Even though this was his first time entering this floor, his mental map of the building led him to his target destination: a room made out of glass walls with frosted strips running horizontally across it. Office 43-19, where the head of the Legal Department should be working one of his late shifts again.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        He peered between the frosted strips into the brightly-lit room and saw a feline figure hunched over the table. Mr Iorvis. Probably tired after a long day of work. Tyrian crouched down and pulled out the thin and sharp metal rod that was held against his ankle under his sock: a weapon he nicknamed the "Needle". Standing back up again, he pulled out a different employee card and tapped on the pass reader beside the door handle.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        There was a soft beep and a voice announced: "Welcome back, Mr Iorvis."

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Tyrian froze in place but the sleeping figure didn't stir. Before the magnetic lock on the door could reactivate, he pulled the door handle and slipped in. Despite the modern design of the building, this office had a mix of modern and traditional furniture that blended together in a harmonious arrangement. A wooden shelf against the wall was lined with abstract metal sculptures and a sleek, black plastic recliner was lined with embroidered pillows. It gave Tyrian a feel of both familiarity and strangeness.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        But he wasn't here to admire the office's interior design. He strode behind the figure and raised the Needle in the air, aiming its spiked tip down at its intended victim. The Needle was a simple but deceptively-effective weapon. It looked innocent enough to go unnoticed to the untrained eye but was dangerous enough to kill. Its extremely sharp tip allowed it to pierce even the thickest of scales and its thin length allowed it to pass between the gaps between the ribs. A stab through the heart was enough to create a gash that would drain the life out of its victim within a matter of minutes. Even if he missed, a lung would take the hit and the target would spend his last minutes gasping for air.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Would he be able to hit the heart? Tyrian plunged the Needle down through the back of the feline. But instead of feeling the firmness of muscles in his grip, he only felt the softness of cotton as the "body" fell off the chair and slumped on the ground.

        Tyrian stepped back from the dummy hastily. This wasn't right. What was going on? There was a loud beep as the magnetic door lock switch into lockdown mode. Metal shutters outside the glass walls quickly descended with a loud clang, trapping him within the office.

        Tyrian looked up at the speakers that the voice came from. This assassination job was a sting operation! He wasn't going to stay here a second longer. He jumped onto the oak desk onto the paperwork scattered across it. A well-aimed punch at the ceiling light showered him with glass shards and plunged the room into darkness.

        The veil of black swallowed up every inch of the room and Tyrian tried to focus on them. The shadows reached out for him, pulling him into their dark mass to teleport him away.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        Tyrian, however, seemed unfazed. He jumped down to the floor and picked up the office chair, throwing it at a glass wall and shattering it. But the metal shutter behind was meant to withstand even the blast of a bomb. He was well and truly trapped.

        A hissing sound filled the room, accompanied by a green gas. From it, Tyrian could smell a sweetness indicative of a sleeping gas. He quickly unbuttoned his shirt and pressed it against his nose and mouth, trying to filter out the gas as he held his breath.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        But it was only a matter of time before his air ran out. He stole a quick breath and the gas filled his lungs, clouding his mind. He wasn't going to make it. But he had to try.

        Kazuki laid on the floor of the empty prison cell. Four bare walls surrounded him on all sides, save for a metal door in the centre of one of them. Built into the door was a narrow barred window that barely let him look into the corridor outside. He shrugged it off as a bad design until he realized the window wasn't for his benefit: it was for the guards to monitor him.

        A bulb was built into the ceiling, confined behind a frosted and translucent plate that was aligned with the ceiling, forming a smooth surface as it diffused the bulb's pale blue light throughout the cell, contrasting the orange prison suit the wolf was wearing. In the corner of the room was a small hole that seemed like a drainage system that Kazuki figured was where his waste would go.

        He had spent the past five days undergoing the torture and interrogation of the prison guards as they tried to force information out of him. Even if he wanted to, Kazuki could not tell them anything. He didn't even know the real names of his gang, much less reveal the identity of the drug cartel's mastermind. All he could do was to endure the punishment for withholding information that was never his to begin with. Under the orange jumpsuit were gashes, welts, and burn marks that were clumsily cleaned up with antiseptic alcohol and patched with band-aids too small for the wounds.

        The cold night was sapping the heat out of the room and the wolf huddled into a corner as he tried to conserve his body heat. A strange "forcefield" hung over the entire prison, neutralizing power-users such as him. Even though he barely used his lightning powers in his day-to-day life, having that robbed from him made him feel even more vulnerable than before.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        He tried to gather his lightning energy in the palm of his hand. A ball of electricity should've materialized in his hand, but within the confines of the prison, he couldn't even feel the energy within his body. All he could feel was just an empty space within him.

        Kazuki sighed. Perhaps they would give up and let him go. Or at least stop the torture. How long would that take? A few days? Weeks? Months? He couldn't bear the thought of another day in the torture chamber, much less another week.

        A ear-chilling scream of a prisoner from another cell echoed through the corridor and into his cell. Kazuki had gotten used to the sounds: sometimes the other inmates would cry out in their sleep, from shouts of terror to pleas of freedom as their dreams trapped them in their mental prisons.

        Tyrian was pushed into a blue prison cell and the metal door was slammed shut behind him. He turned to look at the door behind him before examining the rest of the cell. Contrary to what he first thought, there was, in fact, someone else in the cell. A canine figure was hugging his knees in a sitting position as his squeezed himself in the corner of the cell.

        Tyrian examined the canine. Despite the blue tint that the prison light had given everything in the room, he could make out the white pelt of the huddled wolf. The wolf was looking at him curiously, trying to make out his reaction.

        Tyrian sat in the opposite corner of the room and watched the wolf cautiously. He may look harmless but Tyrian wasn't about to gamble his safety. The wolf's eyes were darting about on the ground as if he was trying to come up with something to say.

        The sirens blared through the prison, telling prisoners to make their way back into the cell. Kazuki dropped the pickaxe and stretched his back. He had spent the day mining boulders into smaller rocks, and smaller rocks into pebbles: the only way the prison knew how to occupy the prisoners and releasing some of their pent-up restlessness.

        He limped back into the prison building and headed to the familiar yet cold cell where his cellmate was already seated. He sat down and leaned against the same wall as the cat, leaving a metre gap between them. After a minute or so, the sirens stopped and the metal door swung close.

        A prison guard went down the corridor, sliding their meal trays through a slot at the bottom of each cell door. One tray was shoved roughly into their cell, spilling some of the rice and gravy onto the floor. The slot was then closed and locked.

        Pushing himself off the ground, Tyrian strode out of the cell as Kazuki returned to his place on the cold floor. Suddenly, the door was slammed behind him and Kazuki could see other guards appear in the corridor. There were sounds of knuckles hitting flesh and gasps of pain.

        They looked at each other in awkward silence. Tyrian noticed a glass of water beside an orange scrap cloth torn from the wolf's prison pants. Both the cloth and the water was stained with a bit of blood. His blood.

        "Go eat something. I saved half for you," Kazuki suddenly spoke up, nodding to the half-eaten mess tray where rice, bits of meat and vegetables were messily mixed across the various compartments. The food that had scattered on the ground from earlier was mostly cleaned up, and Tyrian suspected the wolf would've still considered them edible.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Tyrian wasn't complaining. He was hungry enough to eat just about anything, including any food that had fallen on the dusty ground of the cell. He turned to Kazuki.

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Without hesitation, Tyrian turned to the food and began devouring the scraps, shoving handful after handful of the remaining food into his ravenous mouth. Before he knew it, the tray was clean of every grain of rice and every morsel of food.

        He licked his lips. He wanted more, but there was nothing he could do. In fact, he felt even more hungry now that he had a taste of food. Everything felt cold. The prison felt cold. Their treatment of him felt cold. His insides felt cold. He shivered, trying to avoid the inevitable cold.

        He looked at the wolf, hugging himself with his knees against his chest. He must've felt cold too. Tyrian shifted over to the spot beside Kazuki and huddled close to him. The wolf looked at him in surprise. He was going to open his mouth to say something, but his gaze caught the stoic expression on Tyrian's face and he shut his mouth again, blushing as he did so.

        The warmth of their two bodies together was a much-needed respite from the harshness of the night. Tyrian closed his eyes as he tried to remember the last time he had felt the warmth of another body against his. All that came to mind were the bodies that slumped against him as he drained the life out of them. Nothing was like this.

        The sweltering sun bore down upon Kazuki as he swung his pickaxe down, breaking rock after rock into increasingly-granular chunks. Suddenly, there was a faint sound shouting and of blows being exchanged. Probably another group of fighting inmates. Kazuki ignored the noises and focused on his work. Paying them any heed would not benefit him in any way.

        Guards around him were running towards the direction of the noise, leaving the prisoners alone as they continued to mine the rocks.

        Suddenly, two firm hands pulled him from behind and turned him around. He came face to face with Tyrian.

        "I don't have much time until the distraction is over so listen close," he shrugged off the wolf's question. "Some of us are going to escape in a few days' time."

        Kazuki wanted to ask more, but there would be no more opportunities. During the day, they were separated while they carried out their individual duties. At night, they would be watched in their prison cells.

        Over the past number of weeks, he had been making friends with the inmates assigned to mess duty with him, and friendships turned into an escape plot. Each day, they would steal a whisper back and forth while the guards weren't paying too close attention.

        Five minutes of planning could turn into five hours simply because they couldn't talk openly. He could ask "What can you steal from the supply room?" as the guards changed shifts, only to get a reply "Rope and bedsheets" a few hours later.

        After a while, they settled into a pattern. They could ask each other questions like "Can we dig under the walls" or "When can you get it by?", and a subtle shake of their head or three clangs of the dinner trays would be the reply.

        All that, however, would end today. The four of them had finally gotten everything they needed for the plan. By the end of today, they would either taste freedom or suffer the consequences of failure.

        Tyrian slowly wiped another dinner tray dry before leisurely setting it on the top of a stack of even more trays. Suddenly, the sirens rang, telling all prisoners to go back to their bunks. Tyrian turned to the other inmates in the kitchen and shrugged knowingly before stepping towards the door.

        The inmates grumbled before going back to their tasks. Tyrian turned on the tap and lazily let the stream of water run over the trays. A muscular Doberman named Azuriel gave the guard an evil glare as he picked up the mop again. The dark grey otter named Demir grumbled before resuming his scrubbing of the stove. The last inmate, a lady lizard named Rha joined the otter and pretended to work.

        There was a loud boom and a shock wave shot through the kitchen. Pots and pans hanging on the walls shivered and the four inmates looked at each other incredulously. It worked.

        "Let's go," Tyrian finally said and they swiftly made their way out of the kitchen door. Demir and Azuriel split up from the group, each one headed towards one of the two remaining anti-power field generators.

        Tyrian and Rha crossed the prison yard, swiftly darting from shadow to shadow as they approached the prison headquarters. A guard was standing by the double metal doors as a sentry. Tyrian swiftly emerged from the shadows and strode towards the guard. The movement caught the guards eyes and he turned to look.

        "Hey! What are you doing out-" the guard could barely take out his weapon before he was knocked out by Rha who had snuck behind him. Snatching the ID pass that was hanging from the guard's belt, she swiped it on the black card scanner and the doors beeped as the magnetic locks disengaged.

        They entered the building and made their way past the guard bunks. As expected, all the bunks were empty. All the guards were activated and split up to guard the prison gates, prison cells, and the broken field generator. Things were going as planned.

        Suddenly, the air seemed to shift. The shadows in the corridor shimmered as if welcoming Tyrian back into their arms. Rha could feel it too and they looked at each other knowingly, The other two generators were down.

        Tyrian and Rha stood outside the door of the control room. Tyrian nodded at the lizard, who nodded back at him. With a swift moment, Tyrian kicked open the door and the two of them stepped in. Inside, the prison warden and two more guards were busy monitoring the field generator situation.

        "Why are you?" one guard shouted in surprise as he raised his pistol at the two intruders. Without warning, sharp throwing knives shot out from the shadows and straight into his heart and he crumpled to the ground. Rha struck the other guard down before he could react.

        From the live feed on the monitor screens, Tyrian and Rha could see the cell doors open. Prisoners peered cautiously out of their cells before entering the corridor with disbelief on their faces. Within seconds, the prisoners were rioting.

        "Wait," Tyrian stopped dead in his tracks. In front of them, prison guards were sealing up the manhole, locking the hatch in place with heavy-duty padlocks.

        They had broken into the prison garage where military jeeps and tonners were parked. They were in an armoured jeep as Tyrian fiddled with the wires that would start the ignition.

        There was a victorious spluttering as the jeep's engine came alive. Tyrian pressed a button on the dashboard, raising the shuttered doors to the garage. The road ahead of them went around a bend which would lead straight to the gate.

        Tyrian floored the accelerator and drove the jeep straight ahead and around the bend.

        A hundred metres in front of them were the open gates, littered with dead and bloody bodies. With blaring alarms, the metal gate began closing in on them, dragging the bodies along as they left a trail of blood across the tarmac ground. Guards were also turning on them, shooting bullets that ricocheted off the metal chassis of the jeep.

        "Do your thing," Tyrian said. Kazuki nodded and placed his hand on the jeep's dashboard.

        There was a whirring sound as he charged the vehicle with electricity. The engine seemed to burst with newfound energy and the rear wheels spun with additional velocity. The jeep accelerated forward at an unreal speed, throwing both Tyrian and Kazuki back into their seats as they bolted past the prison buildings. The wind rushed past them, filling the jeep with their deafening whistling sounds.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Guards quickly jumped out of the way as they approached the closing gates. Just a bit more. Kazuki closed his eyes. The jeep shuddered as it tore through the bodies on the ground. There was a pattering sound as the hail of machine gun bullets hit the roof. And then there was nothing.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki opened his eyes. Around them were trees and thick undergrowth that bordered the narrow tarmac road. The jeep had slowed to its regular speed and they were driving down the highway, away from the prison.

        The two of them trudged through the urban landscape into the rundown inner city.  They had ditched the jeep some time back to lose the trail, and they had been trekking through the hills and into the city for the past few hours.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki had come to the realization that he had nowhere else to go. Going home was a surefire way to get caught by the law again. Still, the feeling of freedom tasted good and the adrenaline of the escape was still coursing through him as he led Tyrian lead the way back.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        They came to a short, bunker-like structure that was built into the side of an apartment building. Its door was boarded up with rotten planks and rusty nails. Tyrian went up to the door and pulled Kazuki towards him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki could feel the shadows wrap around the both of them, swallowing them up. There was a moment of darkness and the shadows tore away again. They were on the other side of the boarded door.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Tyrian flicked a switch and the fluorescent lights came on, lighting up the dingy room. Kazuki looked around the place. A half-open door led into a bedroom and another doorway led to the kitchen. He could tell that Tyrian had made efforts to tidy up the house before. Magazines and bills had been messily stacked up in a pile on the corner of the coffee table. Wires from an old computer on the work desk were bundled up with duct tape and stuck to the wall behind.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        There was also a sense of forlornness in the air. A layer of dust had settled over everything through the months of Tyrian's absence. Fruits in a bowl on the dining table had long rotted away and grime on the plates in the kitchen sink had dried up into a crust.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki took a step forward into the living room. There was a thud behind him as Tyrian stumbled forward.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Hey!" the wolf caught the cat before he could hit the ground, "You alright?"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Tyrian nodded weakly. "Tired. Teleport," he explained.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki helped him into the bedroom and sat him down on a chair while he changed the dusty sheets of the single bed. The morning sun was starting to stream in through narrow slits on the walls just below the ceiling: pathetic substitutions for actual windows, but a thousand times more secure.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Carrying the grumbling Tyrian, he dumped him onto the bed where he flopped around exhaustedly before nodding off. Kazuki shook his head and sighed before making his way to the couch. With a rag, he dusted it off before throwing himself onto the worn-out leather. Residual dust flew into the air but the wolf was too tired to mind. In a matter of moments, he joined the cat in the realm of dreamers.
       </span>

     <div class="segment">

        Kazuki woke up with a start, desperately hoping that the escape wasn't a dream that was going to slip away and leave him in the reality of prison.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        He tried to make out shapes in the darkness. But the darkness indicated the absence of blue light. And the soft leather under him replaced the concrete ground he was used to waking up to.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        His heart was beating fast. He got off the couch and made for the bedroom. Through the darkness, he could make out Tyrian's figure fast asleep in bed.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki took a careful step forward into the room. Thoughts of the prison flitted through his mind. Not of the cold, uncaring walls of the cell but of the warmth of the cat's body against his, breaking through the bitter chill like beams of light piercing through the dark.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Before he knew it, he had taken another step into the room. The cat's strong arms around him like a firm foundation in the harsh and stormy reality of the world.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Another step towards the bed. The cat's chest against his. Feeling their heartbeats pulsing at their own tempos in a song only the two of them understood. A sign they were still alive in the deadness of the prison.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        He gently sat on the side of the bed. Tyrian opened his eyes sleepily and saw the wolf as their gazes met. The silence hung between them, strangely soft and comforting. There was no awkwardness in the air, no compulsion to speak. Yet through their eyes, it was almost like they were communicating in a language too intimate for words.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Tyrian finally broke the gaze and shifted to the side of the bed, giving the wolf space. Kazuki gingerly laid down beside him and turned to face the cat. His heart was pounding in his chest. Could Tyrian tell?
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The cat wrapped his arms around and pulled the wolf into a tight embrace. Kazuki rested his chin in the nook of his neck. Another heartbeat joined in with his. Slow. Steady. Comforting.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        And with this comforting lullaby, the both of them fell asleep.

        The sun had risen overhead, its warm beams stealing their way into the privacy of the house and illuminating specks of dust idly floating in the air. Kazuki was lying on the couch as he stirred the air with a finger, swirling the particles around.

        The future seemed so uncertain. But he had never felt any more confident about facing it than he did now. He had lived most of his life without companionship, and now after having tasted it, he had no idea how he had managed to live without it.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Somehow being with Tyrian filled him with something he had not experienced in a long time.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The dust in the air suddenly spun swiftly around his finger as the bedroom door opened and the black cat came into the living room and picked up months-old newspaper out of habit as he sat on the couch near Kazuki's feet. Realizing that they were outdated, he tossed them onto the floor and looked at the daydreaming wolf.

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        There were a few tense moments of silence. Suddenly, the cat broke into a wide grin and gave a light nip on his ear.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Hmm," Tyrian pretended to think before confidently declaring, "You're teasing me." He grinned before lowering himself down onto the couch, hugging the wolf from the front as he stroked his paw through Kazuki's fur on the top of his head and down his back.
