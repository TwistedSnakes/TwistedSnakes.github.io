        Zephyrius opened the gold-trimmed door to his cedar closet with a little more vigour than he normally would, hastily picking out a set of robes before slamming the door shut.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The black jackal quickly let his work robes fall to the floor before slipping into the fresh set of robes. Unlike the strong hues of his work robes, these ones were pastel shades of purple and gold. Its material was light and silky as if meant for the bedroom attire of royalty.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">

        He could barely contain his excitement as he scrambled out of the slave chambers and into the corridors of the fortress of Commander Kyrie. While "fortress" was its technical term, it was merely a formality to acknowledge that it was the dwelling place of a high-ranking military officer.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Zephyrius' eager sprint led him to the central lobby of the fortress where a sandstone fountain stood, surrounded by bushes and short trees that grew from plots of fertile soil built into the ground. From the central fountain extended four channels, forming artificial rivers that led down the various corridors of the fortress. The jackal turned down the middle channel into the north wing of the extensive building.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        His pace slowed down to a brisk walk as he approached the end of the long corridor where tall double doors reached up to the high ceiling. The door was made of impenetrable steel, reinforced with magic that laid in its runic inscriptions that ran around its gold-trimmed borders.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The jackal smoothened his robes before reaching for the silver doorknob that hung from the jaws of a crafted feline head. He knocked it sharply twice before stepping back. The enchanted doors opened up for him, revealing the sleeping chambers of Kyrie. The massive room was made out of pale yellow stone, adorned with subtle inscriptions and murals that seemed to fade in and out with the light.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        From the ceiling hung a giant chandelier made of various sizes of gold rings inlaid with glowing crystals. Each ring hung separate from the rest, held together by enchantments as they floated in the air, rotating around each other in a choreographed dance of light and shadow. At the end of the room was a large bed lined with thick, silk sheets, dyed red with the pigment of alkanet roots. Translucent pale-pink curtains hung from the wooden frame of the bed.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        But the grandeur of the room was not what caught his eyes. Instead, his attention was turned to a cream-white lioness standing in the middle of the room. Her sky-blue silk robes clung close to her body, contrasting the yellow room as they revealed her slender curves.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Master Kyrie," the jackal bowed as he approached her, caressing his bare feet against the fuzzy pelt of the large, circular carpet in the middle of the room. His heart was beating from anticipation. It's been so long.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Zephyrius," she acknowledged. Seconds of silence hung between them, comfortable except for the inner impatience of the jackal.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "So," Kyrie finally broke the silence, "Why do you think I called you here today?"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "My six months in chastity is up, Master," came the meek reply.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "That is correct," the lioness smiled and Zephyrius could feel the air of confidence around her through her assured eyes and lightly curled lips. "And what does that mean?" she asked almost teasingly.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "I get my reward, Master?" Zephyrius asked hesitantly as if asking for reprieve from his long endurance of celibacy was taboo, almost blasphemous.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "And that would be?" Kyrie seemed unfazed at the question.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "One day of release," the jackal responded. His heart was beating rapidly in his chest. Would she deny him his long-awaited freedom? It wasn't out of the question. After all, rewards were but a privilege; one that could be bestowed with a single breath and taken away just as easily.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "That is correct," the lioness' voice broke through his swarming thoughts.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The jackal let out a breath of relief he didn't notice he was holding in. This was it. He was going to be released!
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "But," she reminded the excited slave, "After you've had your fun, it's another six months of being locked up. Is that understood?"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Yes, Master," Zephyrius consented. The sun was almost overhead so he had a few short hours before his chastity cage would be locked in place another half of the solar celestial cycle. While he yearned for more, he would adhere to his Master's allowances and make the most of it.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Strip," Kyrie commanded.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        As if already anticipating her instructions, the jackal unravelled the layers of robes that he was wearing, folding them up in a pile that could just barely be counted as neat before laying them on the floor on the outer edge of the carpet. He stood back up to face Kyrie, wearing only his golden earrings, a purple collar, and the main attraction: a metal chastity device. A silver ring wrapped behind his two eager balls, securing the rest of the cage in place. The cage's tip was shaped in the likeness of a lioness, wrapping her open jaws around the peaking tip of Zephyrius' member. There was no sight of a lock to secure the device in place but it was held in place by runic inscriptions that lined the length of the length of the cage, faded away as their six-month period of sealing ended.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Whether the concealing of his manhood served as a remnant of his dignity or stripped of his remaining pride was up to anyone's interpretation, but to the jackal, it was an honour to give up his pleasure for the sake of his Master's own.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Kneel," the lioness ordered.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Zephyrius knelt in the middle of the carpet and looked up expectantly at Kyrie. She stepped towards Zephyrius and joined him on the rug. With gentle but purposeful movements her hands stroked the jackal's body, one going over his shoulder and caressing his back while the other one fondled his caged cock.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The jackal shuddered, feeling Kyrie's hands over his body. With his dick in its metal encasement, he could only imagine her touch against his sensitive skin. Patience. He had to exercise patience.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Pulling herself close, Kyrie leaned her chin on Zephyrius' shoulder. Her lips whispered some incantations and the runes on the chastity cage disappeared. The ring and the shaft of the cage came apart and the lioness' hands slowly guided it off the jackal's trembling cock. It slid off, pulling a trail of sticky pre with it as it revealed Zephyrius' fully-erect shaft as if presenting itself to Kyrie.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The jackal purred contentedly as he nuzzled against his Master's cheek. The freedom from his cage was a huge relief. He hadn't noticed how tense his body was until then as he let his body relax and his shoulders fall.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kyrie smiled as she pulled away from the embrace and pulled out a golden silk sash from her robes. She stretched it tight and held it at eye level before wrapping it around the jackal's head as a blindfold. Her hands looped it behind the back, pulling it tight as her fingers knotted the ends together securely.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Comfortable?" she asked as she ran her hands down Zephyrius' chest.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The jackal nodded. The deprivation of his sight served to heighten his other senses. He could hear Kyrie's heavy breathing in front of him, her warm and delicate breaths joining her fingers as they traced the outline of his pecs. Her individual digits moved in an intricate choreography as they danced their way down to Zephyrius' abs, rising and falling with the mountains and valleys of his sculpted torso.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        His reverie was briefly interrupted by a click around his neck as something was secured to his collar. The additional weight was a familiar sensation: one of a leash that Kyrie would sometimes lead him around with. But his thoughts soon led back to the lioness' fingers tracing the head of his twitching cock. A soft moan escaped his lips as his sensitive flesh felt physical touch for the first time in six months, made even more intense with the blinding of his sight.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Zephyrius felt the lioness hand grasp his shaft, giving it a firm squeeze.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Ngnn," the jackal could barely hold himself back from thrusting his hips into his Master's hands. Instead, he reigned in his carnal desires and settled for squirming uneasily in his kneeling position.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Master Kyrie," the feminine voice of another person pierced through their trances like a dagger through silk.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The jackal could hear Kyrie get up in front of him.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "I do not wish to be disturbed," her sharp voice snapped.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "But, but-" came the stammers of the other person he could not see.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "It's an emergency. The Pharaoh wishes to see you," the voice of the slave tried to remain composed as she explained.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        There was a moment of hesitation and Zephyrius could feel Kyrie's gaze turn to him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Fine. Tell Pharaoh that I'll be with him in twenty minutes," she ordered.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The sound of scuttling feet followed the slave out of the room. Kyrie knelt down beside the jackal.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Stay here," the lioness' command filled his ears as she knelt down and tugged on his leash. He could feel his collar moving as if she were securing the other end of the leash to something else. Zephyrius nodded. It wasn't like he had a choice.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Kyrie got up and her footsteps towards the door. There was a pause.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The large doors closed shut with a deep booming sound, leaving him in the room, silent but alive with the pulsing aura of magic from the surrounding runes.

        Time seemed to pass slowly. There was nothing but his thoughts to accompany him in the darkness of his blindfold. He tried to shift his legs to ease his uncomfortable kneeling position but the short leash didn't give him enough slack to stand up.

        As if to confirm his suspicions, a deep and gruff voice called out, "Look what we have here." There was a hint of eager malice in his voice that filled Zephyrius with a sense of dread.

        The jackal didn't appreciate it. Instead, he started struggling, breaking free from the lion's grasp as he tried to crawl away. Suddenly, the stinging fall of the whip struck his back, causing him to stop in his tracks as he gasped in pain.

        The lion took no notice of the jackal's plight. Instead, he grabbed Zephyrius' wrists and bound them together with thick rope so that his two forearms were restrained together. He then shoved the jackal to the ground where he fell with a thud on the carpet with his face in the fur. He groaned in pain, muffled by the gag in his mouth and the soft fur in his face.

        The lion wasn't about to stop there. Grabbing Zephyrius' ankles, he pulled the jackal towards him and propped his butt up, presenting it to the lion. Zephyrius whimpered helplessly, frozen in his pose by a combination of physical fatigue and emotional fear.

        Suddenly, a warm and wet sensation assaulted his pucker, feeling his sides with its rough surface. The lion was rimming him! The jackal struggled but to no avail; the lion had dug his claws into his thighs, holding his hips in place and exposing his vulnerable tailhole.

        "Yhh!" he squealed as the tongue pressed firmly against the entrance of his pucker, pushing its saliva-lubricated tip through the opening. He could feel the lion explore his insides, leaving his makeshift lubricant everywhere as it pressed against his internal muscles.

        With the uninvited invasion in his behind, the jackal could not help but blush. While he didn't want to be sexually assaulted in this way, he couldn't deny that he was getting turned on with the anal stimulation he was receiving.

        He could feel one of the lion's hands release his hips. Where it was going was soon answered as a strong grasp wrapped around his sensitive balls. The lion gave them a soft squeeze that sent shivers down the jackal's spine. The fingers slowly pinched, pushing his testicles back and forth between the narrow gap formed between his index finger and thumb. The pain and pleasure were too much for him but there was nothing he could do about it.

        He gave the tongue in his rear a squeeze with his muscles and whimpered as the tongue pushed back. His own tongue was hanging out of his panting mouth. He felt ashamed from the possibility that Kyrie could walk in right now and see him in his pathetic state...

        The lion withdrew his tongue from the jackal's tailhole, leaving in its wake copious amounts of natural lube. A clawed finger took its place, wriggling its way into him, eliciting a sound that was a mix of a moan and a whimper. The finger slowly slid in and out of him, pressing against the edges of his tight tailhole and he squeezed his pucker in return.

        It wasn't right for him to do this but his pent-up libido demanded otherwise. He slowly began to shift his hips back and forth, fucking himself against the extended digit. Anything to relieve himself of the tension that had built up over the past six months.

He had been used in the ass countless times in the past, each time under Kyrie's consent as she let her guests, from royalty to business partners, use him to their heart's content. And each time he took the cock as if it was an expression of servitude to his Master. But this was different; she did not permit this, but yet he was allowing himself to be fucked like that.

        The cock was thrust in and out faster and faster, spreading the lion's saliva everywhere between his butt cheeks. Their moans filled the room as the lion slammed his manhood against the inner flesh of the jackal, rubbing its soft barbs against the slave's ass.

        The jackal's whines softened and he lapped up the residual cum on the lion's erect member. The prospect of pain was a strong motivator and the desperate slave was more than willing to be pulled along for the ride.

        The lion moaned loudly as Zephyrius hungrily slurped up the mess. Before long, the lion's hard member was cleaned up, left slick with the jackal's saliva.

        "Well, don't mind if I do," the lion panted as he grabbed the slave with one hand on either side of his head. The jackal was jerked forward, bringing the lion's shaft further into his mouth. The tip of the feline cock poked the back of his throat, causing him to gag.

        Zephyrius tried to calm himself down and relax his throat. He had taken shafts bigger than this. But the lack of preparation and the stress of getting raped in his Master's bedroom took him by surprise, making him too panicky to keep his composure. The gag made it impossible for him to resist the lion's invasion. Instead, he could only hold back his gagging, reducing them to uncontrollable shivers and helpless whimpers.

        The lion's cock continued to abuse his mouth and his throat, causing the jackal to whine in time with each thrust of his hips. His gasps must've been music to the lion's ears for he had started to moan in unison.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The thrusts got faster and faster, leading up to the inevitable; the lion flooded his maw with more warm fluids. Some of it washed down Zephyrius' throat and he instinctively tightened his throat, refusing to swallow any more.

        His abuser, however, had other ideas. He grabbed the jackal's chin and forcefully tilted his head upwards, channelling the seed to the back of his throat where it pooled.

        "You look cute like that," the feline purred, "Did anyone tell you that?" His hands caressed the jackal's face, smearing the sticky fluids all over before rubbing the rest of it into the slave's hair.

        He gave Zephyrius a kiss on the tip of the jackal's open maw, wrapping his lips around the slave's nose and gently sucking. The jackal could feel the lion's tongue explore his muzzle enthusiastically, leaving sloppy spit all over his fur.

        Suddenly, the sound of footsteps entered the room, coming to a halt as the two new visitors were greeted with the sight of the two animals engaging in passionate, one-sided intercourse.

        "S-sorry for disturbing you, sir," gasped the visitor that Zephyrius could not see. It was the voice of Sadhek, another servant of the fortress.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        It wasn't Kyrie, but then again salvation came in many forms and he wasn't about to be picky. He hurriedly pulled free of the kiss and turned toward the direction of the voice. Using the elbows of his bound arms he tried to scramble forward. The leash, however, was jerked back so he couldn't leave the perimeter of the carpet. He wasn't going to be defeated so easily.

        "Ngnn!" the plug in his ass sent waves of pain and pleasure through the jackal as the lion tugged on its base. The lion twisted the plug back and forth as he inched the knot out of the jackal's hole but the sphincter had relaxed, closing around the narrow neck of the dildo.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        There was a pop as the knot finally escaped his pucker, leaving a gaping hole still soaked in cum. A hole which the lion did not hesitate to restuff with his virile manhood, thrusting in and out with renewed vigour.

        The jackal could barely contain himself too; the scent of the horny lion was also driving his own libido mad. He moved his hips back and forth in rhythm with the lion's, tensing his sphincter muscles as he took in the entirety of the lion's shaft. The cum from before only served to lubricate the stretched and abuse hole that used to be his tight tailhole.

        "Gah! F-fuck..." the lion gasped. All rational thought had left his mind, leaving behind a primal instinct to fuck the hell out of the ass in front of him.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The same could've been said for Zephyrius. Six months. Six whole months. If he had to go, he had to go. His muffled moans reflected his aroused state as he fucked himself silly on the lion's massive cock. He could've sworn he could see stars despite the blindfold.

        The jackal could also feel the tension and pressure in his crotch. He was going to cum! The lion, however, must've noticed his thrusts. A hand firmly grabbed the base of his shaft, squeezing it like a cockring and preventing him from cumming.

        At the same time, the lion shot the entirety of his seed into the squirming jackal, filling his rear with the warm and sticky fluids once again.

        His leash on his collar was released and the ropes to his arms were untied. But before he could escape, his own silky robes were wrapped around him, immobilizing him in a tight bundle. His gag was also unfastened, giving him some time to relax his jaw before another length of silk looped around his muzzle and held it close. The blindfold was loosened and for a second the bright crystals of the chandelier blinded him before the rest of his robes bundled him up into a squirming cocoon.

        But not one of them stopped the lion to find out more. Each one walked by nonchalantly, refusing to get their hands dirty with the deeds of others. The lion brought him out a doorway and he was greeted by the ambient sounds of the world outside the fortress. If he was going to escape, he should do it before the lion could bring him too far.

        Zephyrius' whimpers could be barely be heard outside of the bundle of robes he was in and his struggles got him nowhere fast. He was just about to give up when the lion suddenly tossed his body forward. His heart lurched in his chest in the short freefall before his body hit the water.

        Was the lion trying to drown him? His robes soaked up the water as he sunk beneath the surface. He held his breath as he tried to wriggle in his cocoon, pushing the fabric out of the way. The layers floated off him and the jackal quickly swam to the surface.

        There was a splash as he panted for air. His eyes adjusted to the brightness of the outside and he saw that he was in the artificial oasis of Kyrie's fortress.

        "Caelan!" he gasped as he recognized the cream-white lion who had already made himself comfortable at the edge of the pool, "It's you."

        The panting jackal made his way over to the lion and joined him on the smooth rock that functioned as a seat. "I-I was panicking, alright?"

        Zephyrius blushed in embarrassment, feeling stupid from his baseless panics. The lion wrapped an arm around his shoulder and pulled him close until he was leaning on the feline's shoulder. Caelan's other hand stroked his chest, moving over to his nipples as he slowly gave them a squeeze.

        The jackal let out a small gasp of pleasure, nuzzling against the lion's neck as the clear waters of the pool washed away the physical gunk from his fur and the mental stress from his mind. Zephyrius closed his eyes and slowly drifted off to sleep.

        The sound of a familiar, warm, and comforting voice woke him up. His heart beat excitedly as he turned around to look into the face of his Master Kyrie.

        Caelan and Zephyrius got out of the pool and bowed to her, wetting the ground with the water that dripped off their drenched fur.

        In the meantime, Kyrie procured the lioness chastity device from her robes. "I assume the release was much welcome?" she asked as she hooked the ring behind the jackal's balls.

        "Very well," Kyrie interrupted the jackal's objection as she chanted incantations of ancient magic. Runes appeared on the chastity cage, once again binding it in place.

        The jackal hastily put on the purple and gold robes that were folded on a flat boulder. While he really wanted to cum, the prospect of his Master's wrath was not something he would like to trifle with. Even then, the seal on his chastity cage wasn't coming off anytime soon. He whimpered silently in his mind. His libido would be his own problem to deal with.

        "The meeting with Pharaoh was...trying, to say the least. I have to meet up with the other generals to discuss our military strategies before the sun is down, so I could do with less trouble for the rest of today," she sighed again.

       Six months in chastity is up for Zephyrius, and he eagerly awaits his release with Kyrie, his master. After his chastity is released, he is blindfolded, collared, leashed, and teased. However, Kyrie is interrupted by urgent matters that she is forced to attend to, leaving Zephyrius there.

       While Zephyrius waits for Kyrie's return, an unknown intruder, a lion, comes in to harass the jackal. He forces a ring gag in Zephyrius' mouth, ties him up, and whips him. The lion proceeds to rim him and play with his balls. After that, he fingers Zephyrius before fucking him to the point of orgasm. Zephyrius' tailhole is then plugged by an oversized knotted dildo to keep the cum in.

       However, the lion wasn't done. The jackal is forced to clean up the lion's cock with his tongue, only to be forced to suck the lion off to orgasm again. The lion then removed Zephyrius' anal plug and fucks the hole, again to orgasm. He then pisses in the jackal's mouth, forcing him to swallow when the lion blocks his nose. Lastly, the lion pisses all over the jackal and kidnaps him.

       Zephurius finds himself taken and thrown into the palace pools, where, with his blindfold removed, he realizes the lion was a friend of his, Caelan.  They relax in the pool until Kyrie comes back, locking Zephyrius in another six months of chastity without letting him orgasm.
