    <div id="story-form"><div class="story-container"><div class="story"><p class="title align-left">Corruption of the Wolf</p><p class="subtitle align-left">Written by TwistedSnakes</p><div class="title-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The sound of smashing concrete above Decro made him duck as a clawed tendril slammed into the concrete building to his left. The white arctic wolf jumped forward into a dive roll, barely escaping the chunks of wall that shattered into concrete fragments as they hit the ground behind him. His grey shirt and black jeans were coated in a layer of concrete dust as he got back up.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was no time to stop and recover. The tarmac road beneath him was cracking into chunks that remained suspended in the air. He continued his way down what was left of the road, swiftly jumping from chunk to chunk as he made his way through the empty city.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A high-pitched, bone-chilling roar sounded behind him and Decro stole a glance behind him. Hovering above the wreckage of the floating town was a strange monstrosity. Its black, draconic face had ten eyes and numerous twisted horns surrounded its face that towered over the wolf. The smokey body behind it was like that of an eastern dragon but if one looked closely, one could see what seemed like moving scales were actually a writhing mass of serpents, coiling around each other in an uncoordinated dance. Protruding off the sides of its body were writhing tentacles with vicious claws at their tips, waving menacingly at its prey.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf, however, had no time to concern himself with the hideousness of the beast. Instead, he had already taken off on the floating path, careful not to fall between the gaps into the gaping abyss below.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The urban landscape before him had crumbled into huge floating debris. Two concrete skyscrapers had fallen over, gliding past each other like bridges over a chasm. With a running jump, Decro landed heavily on the nearest tower.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A clawed arm slammed the tower beside the wolf, causing it to begin tilting downwards to that side. Fighting against gravity, Decro dug his claws into the concrete wall and climbed up the steadily-steepening building. Once he was level with the adjacent tower, he jumped across the dark gap below him to the next building.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He continued his sprint down the tower and threw himself to the safety of a relatively-unfragmented ground. There was a shriek from the beast and the sound of crushing concrete could be heard. The beast was gaining on him and Decro could hear the sound of its heavy breaths as he ran down the cracked pavement.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The beast swiped a clawed tendril and it caught the wolf in the back, tearing through his shirt and throwing him into the brick wall of an apartment building.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gah!" he gasped in pain as his bones hit the unyielding wall. But he needed to escape. He tried to get up but a sharp pain in his ribs made short work of his efforts and he collapsed to the ground.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The beast hovered over him, reaching out its claws and pressing down upon his chest, pinning him down on the ground. The pain in his body was excruciating and he yelled in pain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The beast was hovering over him, bringing its boney head close to Decro. Its ten red, empty eyes peered eerily at him and Decro could feel its damp breath wash over his body. Its serpentine body writhed behind the beast, emitting black wisps of smoke over the area.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro pushed with all his might, trying to pry the claws off him. The beast, however, took no notice of his pain. The beast raised its arm high above its head, threatening to slam into the wolf and end his life.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Suddenly, there was a glimmer in the air. Was it his escape?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But things moved too fast and the clawed arm slammed hard into him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Everything went black.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro woke up. The pain in his body had faded away into a dull ache and he slowly got to his feet. His eyes adjusted to the dim, red room around him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The room was circular in shape and red stone blocks formed its curved walls. Torches lined its walls, bathing the room in a dull reddish-orange glow as their light reflected off the stone.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>In the middle of the room were two round pillars that stood two meters apart. They must've been ceremonial as they were a head taller than Decro but came nowhere close reaching to the high ceiling of the room. There were no exits to be found in the room, neither door nor manhole could be seen.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Was he dead? Was this hell? But he didn't feel "dead", whatever that felt like. although something in the air unnerved him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Decro," a feminine voice called from behind him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf turned around to find the source of the voice and saw a black dragoness standing in the corner of the room, wearing a slim, black dress and a smug grin on her face. Had she always been there?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Where am I? And who are you?" he asked suspiciously.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Me?" she purred, gracefully stepping over to the standing wolf, leaving trails of black wisps behind her, "Shouldn't you know me well by now?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The answer came to him almost immediately: </span><span class="italic">the Beast</span><span>.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You," Decro seethed scathingly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yes, me..." she hissed in return, still smirking as she circled the wolf, caressing his shoulders and back with her slender hands.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro shrugged her hands off him. "Don't touch me," he demanded. Even if the Beast was in this form, he knew that it had no true gender. Just a being of pure evil and malice.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Or?" she raised her brow and challenged him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro growled back in response. Her question caught him off guard, and indeed there was nothing he could do.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She circled back to his front and traced her hands across his chest.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Don't," Decro grabbed her wrists and lifted her palms off him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fighting back again?" she confidently smiled, her lips curling with hints of malice, "Your persistence is admirable but futile."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She paused, looking Decro straight in the eye. He glared back at her in silence.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Watch," she instructed and immediately a huge, invisible force struck the wolf in his chest, throwing him to the centre of the room between the two pillars.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gah!" Decro grunted in pain. The aches from before were coming back and he gritted his teeth as he tried to resist the agony and get up.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragoness opened the palm of her right hand towards him and waved it upwards. At the same time, Decro felt an unseen grip on his wrists lift him upwards into a standing position. Two chains from each of the two pillars shot out at his wrists and ankles, cuffing them and pulling them tightly into a spreadeagle position between the two stone posts.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What's this?" Decro growled as he tugged against the chains. The strong metal, however, didn't give. "Let me out!" he threatened.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Shush," the dragon as waved her hand as if to brush off the wolf's demands. The chains around the pillars pulled upwards, pulling Decro upwards with them. He was close to being yanked off the ground, forcing him to stand on the balls of his feet to support his body weight. His arms immediately felt the strain and his body aching came back in full force.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ugh!" Decro grunted in pain as he glared at the dragoness. Her skinny dress swept around her ankles as she strolled over to stand in front of the wolf and held his chin with her clawed thumb and index finger.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gah!" the wolf forcefully pulled his head away but she only grabbed his chin again and turned his head to face her, digging deep into his flesh with her claws to prevent him from pulling away. She looked into Decro's eyes and he could see the malice in her face.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She had a hint of greed in her expression and the smirk in her eyes and lips was smug. Like she was the hunter and he was her prey. Like she was the owner and he was her object.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He glared back at her in silent protest. "What do you want?" he sneered, trying to hide his aching pain from her gaze.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I want..." she purred, letting go of his chin, turning instead to stroke his muscular chest through his grey shirt. "Your body," she finished.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She dug a clawed finger through the wolf's shirt and pulled downwards, ripping it down the middle of his chest.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hey! What are you doing?" Decro gasped, more in surprise than in pain, "What are you doing?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Like I said," the dragoness' eyes narrowed seductively at him as soon her hands traced the contours of the wolf's sculpted body, tensed up as he tried to support himself. "I want your body."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And my body is not for you to have," Decro retorted, tugging against his chains as if to prove his point. His feet almost slipped and the tension in his muscles sent a shot of pain through his body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Nghn!" he grunted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Noticing his pain, her eyes flitted up to his and she smiled smugly at him. Decro growled in response.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And who decides if I should have you or not?" she grinned, slowly caressing the side of the wolf's face, stroking his soft, fuzzy cheek with a gentle hand.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I do," Decro snorted, this time not making any attempts to struggle lest he inflicted more pain upon himself.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'm afraid you're not in any position to decide..." her voice trailed off as her hands moved all over his chest, tracing his pecs and abs under the torn shirt. Her claws slid under the sleeves of his shirt and slowly tore down its sides, allowing her to pull the shredded cloth off his body and revealing the entirety of his naked torso.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She stepped back to admire her handiwork: a bound up wolf on display, presented nicely just for her. Still keeping her eyes on him, she took her time as she circled around her captive to the back. Ridges of bones and muscles weaved across the wolf's back. His shoulders and upper back were more defined from tensing to hold himself up.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Smiling in a mix of contentment and eagerness, she stepped towards Decro, reaching out her hands to run her fingers through his soft fur and rugged curves. There was a sound of clinking chains as the wolf adjusted himself to ease the strain on the balls of his feet.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Nghh..." despite himself, Decro couldn't help but enjoy her smooth hands across his body. He grunted annoyedly, trying not to give his pleasure away as her fingers firmly squeezed the muscles on his back, massaging his shoulders as she had her way with him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He adjusted his feet again to reduce the strain. The dragoness' hands moved down his back, feeling their way around his lower torso and waist. She let out an involuntary gasp of pleasure as she pulled her body close until her chest pressed against his back. Her fingers ran up and down every inch of his abs, stroking their ridges and valleys in smooth but firm motions.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The both of them stood there, each silently moaning as they shared their body heat. The dragoness' fingers were still gently kneading Decro's body, washing away the pain and aching. The chains clinked again as he shifted his body to lessen the strain on his arms.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Enjoying yourself, Decro?" the dragoness put her chin on his shoulder and purred into his ear.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf's expression hardened and he grunted in response, but his scowl gradually softened as her fingers worked his body. There was a soft groan of reluctance and he nodded his head.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Very good..." she whispered. Her two hands moved up to his chest, circling his pecs until her fingers touched his supple nipples. She traced the edges of his nipples, massaging them with the edges of her claws.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mgnn..." Decro felt a small pinch of pain as she squeezed his nipples. This felt wrong; his mind wanted to tell her to stop but his body couldn't help but yearn for her touch. He was barely able to stop himself from gasping for more as he clenched his teeth and looked away.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Her touch was intoxicating. Almost as if her hands could pierce his veins and fill every inch of him in pure euphoria. Decro's breaths were slow and deep as if all it took was just one loud gust of his breath would chase those tender hands away. The contrast of his firm muscles to her soft skin sent shivers down his spine and his wrists jiggled the chains again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As one of the dragoness' hands stroked his chest, the other moved down to his crotch and gave it a firm squeeze.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gngh!" he wanted to shout out in protest but his carnal desire for more of her kept his mouth shut. Her palm was open fully, rubbing up and down the bulge that had appeared in his pants.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Would he...?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Should he...?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He stopped resisting and let his feral pleasures take over. His hips moved to the motion of her hands, feeling her fingers through the fabric of his jeans. His member slowly begun to emerge from his sheath, trapped under the tight prison of his pants. Still, it didn't stop him from taking in every bit of erotic stimulation. His soft moans gave his pleasure away, blending in with the dragoness' as they both indulged in the bodies of each other.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Stepping under his left arm, the dragoness made her way to the front. Decro eyed her with a faint hint of weariness, overshadowed by the inner he was feeling. And she was going to quench it. Her eyes fell on the wolf's expression and she smiled smugly in return, letting out a silent chuckle.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She slid her finger up the metal zipper of his pants, stroking the length of his rock-hard shaft through his clothes as she teased the prison his dick was in.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gngg..." Decro bit his lip as he tried to suppress his shaky breaths. The tension was just too much for him to bear and he was doing all he could to stop himself from giving in to his carnal instincts.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Watching his expression intently, the dragoness' fingers moved over to the clasp of his pants, as if to begin taking it off. Decro looked at her suspiciously but his desperation showed on his face.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He wanted to yell at her.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Tear at her.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Snap at her.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For all his embarrassment and sexual grief she was subjecting him to.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But he wanted her to continue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gahh!" he gasped and looked away in shame, not daring to face the person who had reduced him to a horny and desperate dog.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But his body was screaming for more, and she was waiting. He could still feel her hands over his waist, poised over his zip expectantly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She was waiting for a signal.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A signal from him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A signal he vehemently wanted to give.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He looked back into her expectant face. She was waiting for him to say yes. Her smirk gave it away that she knew it would come to this. That he would come crawling to her like this. But he was too tired, too eager to resist.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With heavy reluctance, Decro nodded. The dragoness unclasped the top of his pants and pulled down the zipper, revealing his black spandex underwear tenting as his solid dick filled it out. She gave the bulge a firm squeeze, wrapping her fingers around his shaft through the soft fabric.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Moan for me if you want more," the dragoness whispered.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ngnn..." the wolf gasped softly without hesitation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mmm, that's my boy," she purred as she gave the bulge a light pat. Her hands moved to his pants and underwear and with a smooth motion, she ripped her claws through the legs of the pants. The shreds of spandex and denim fell to the floor, leaving the wolf hanging naked and exposed. His member stood tall and erect in front of him, giving him nowhere to hide his arousal.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragoness closed her fingers around the wolf's knot, circling them around the two bulbs around the shaft. Decro's cock twitched in earnest desire and he tugged against his bindings. He wanted release, but of a different kind this time.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With her right hand still stroking the wolf's dick, she stepped under Decro's right arm until she was behind him. She leaned in and placed her slender jaw upon the wolf's muscular shoulder as she continued to tease his pink flesh.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro could feel her supple chest through her tight dress, pressing against the shoulder blades of his back as she wrapped her arms around him from behind. He shifted his feet, trying to adjust his body support as he focused fully on her flesh against his. The dragoness slid her fingers up the wolf's erect shaft, squeezing the tip where beads of precum had already formed, dripping down his length. She smeared it all over the tip of his dick, giving it a smooth, shiny sheen and she let out a soft moan into Decro's ear.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She shifted her hips, moving her body up and down against the wolf's soft, furry form. Her hands began stroking up and down his canid cock, lubricated by the pre he was producing.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gnggrr!" he lifted his head and groaned in pleasure. He shuddered against the chains, creating faint clinking noises as he let each pump of his cock send a wave of pleasure running through him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Let me have your body..." she hissed seductively into his ear.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Lost to his desires, Decro could only nod as he grunted in ecstasy. His vision blurred as his deep cravings took over his mind. So engrossed was he in his pleasure that he took no notice of the blackness that crept in from the corner of his eye.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro felt her aura all over his body, washing over him as he indulged in her euphoria and her in his. But her presence seemed to be getting thicker and thicker around him. He tried to focus his eyes and looked down. The darkness around his vision turned out to be black, wispy tendrils wrapping themselves around his body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What the-" he gasped in surprise and tried to turn to look at the dragoness behind him. Her face against his cheek stopped him from turning too far as she smiled slyly at him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yes?" she feigned ignorance and continued stroking his cock. Her body continued to spew a smoky liquid around Decro's body, engulfing and enveloping the wolf in her ethereal body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What are you doing?" he grunted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'm taking what I want," she nuzzled against his cheek. The blackness around his body wrapped his form tightly, turning into a shiny, rubber-like material. The dragoness' latex form fused with his, encasing his entire body below his neck in a black, leaving a rubber suit that hugged his body and emphasizing the curves of his muscles that hid beneath his fur. His dick was encased in a form-fitting latex sheath, hiding his hard flesh under its rubber. The light of the room's torches reflected off his smooth sheen on his body as the dragoness continued to pump his smooth, rubber cock with increased vigour.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gnhhh..." he groaned, trying to resist humping himself against her skilful hands as he tried to get her body off him. But what could he do? His body was restrained by the heavy chains, leaving nowhere to run from her. With the exception of her head and hands, the dragoness body had almost fused with his.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Give it to me," she purred again. Her voice echoed loudly in Decro's mind. </span><span class="italic">Almost like she was...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Wait.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Her voice was in his head! She was entering his mind and taking over his body. Thinking seemed to get harder as if she was wrestling control away from him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ngnn, get out of my head!" he yelled in agony. He tried in vain to push her stimulation of his erogenous zones as he fought for control of his thoughts. The rubber suit around him was slowly squeezing parts of his body in a gentle massage, forcefully arousing him to levels he had not known before. He was going to-</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>No! He needed to focus. If he came now, the prolactin rush would tire him out, rendering him unable to fight back. And he needed to fight back. He could feel her thoughts pierce his, telling him to give in to her. To give up his body to her pleasures. To allow himself the orgasm he craved so desperately.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Don't resist me," she coaxed, "Cum for me."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"N-no," he gasped as he tried to fight back. A layer of latex rose up from his neck, wrapping around the lower half of his face in a constricting muzzle around his maw.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft!" Decro whined in panic as he frantically turned his head left and right as he tried in vain to throw the muzzle off. The rubber was up to his eyes, threatening to engulf his entire body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hlffpt!" he pleaded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Don't be worried," the dragoness stroked his latex chest with one hand as she continued pumping his shaft with the other, "Give yourself up to me and I'll take good care of you." Her voice dripped with seduction as she flooded his resisting thoughts with words of her own.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro struggled against the chains, tugging against them as he tried to escape. All his efforts were futile and his feral cravings had him thrusting his dick into his hands. His mind felt clouded with darkness, making it hard to move, hard to think. The only thing he could focus on was the rush of pleasure that his hungry cock was enjoying.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His breathing was reduced to shallow huffs, each one in time with his hip thrusts. The arousal in him was getting too much to hold back. Just one orgasm. Just one.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He wanted, no, he </span><span class="bold">needed</span><span> this.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He couldn't fight it anymore. With a loud gasp, he shot his huge load in front of him, painting the stony floor white. His throbbing dick continued to pump the last drops of his cum out, leaving him panting for air as he hung his head in fatigue and embarrassment.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Good puppy," the dragoness milked the last of his seed out of the shaft, slowly pressing her thumb on his tapered tip, tormenting his sensitive flesh as she rubbed it hard.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro groaned from behind his muzzle as he tried to garner his strength to endure. She was pushing his latex-encase cock back into his sheath, hiding his member. As the wolf watched, another layer of rubber seeped from her hand, hardening around his sheath and balls into a metallic black chastity cage.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Don't worry," she smirked at him, "You won't be needing it."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft!" he whimpered helplessly as his manhood was locked away. He looked away helplessly as the dragoness' hands continued stroking the cage, teasing his member with her touch that he'd never feel again. She pressed the cage down against his crotch, rubbing it down with another layer of rubber. The latex sheet fused against his body, leaving behind a smooth, dickless surface around his crotch.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Nggnftt! Gnrr!" Decro shook his head violently as the dragoness sealed him off. Taking no notice of her squirming victim, she merged her form with the wolf, twisting her hands and head with his. The rubber encased Decro's head as he struggled in vain to break free. Her thoughts were fully flooding his mind and he could hear her voice in his head.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"It's over, you're mine now," she coaxed. His body started to lose its strength and he hung limply from his chains.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">He couldn't just...give up like that...could he?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was losing control of his body, barely able to fight the chains that held him. His mind felt more and more clouded, leaving him lesser and lesser space. The darkness in his head was slowly engulfing his consciousness.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"G-get out..." he feebly resisted but the dragoness had too much of a foothold within him. Everything went dark around him as his mind was encased in the dragoness' rubber and sealed away, giving her full control of her newly-acquired body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yes..." a gruff voice emerged from the black latex wolf's mouth. The chains binding him in place fell away and he raised a hand in front of him, admiring the handiwork of the smooth rubber that formed his new skin.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The new body was working out well for him. A physical host for his demonic essence so he could walk the earth and filling it with his corruption. Then the world shall know the name of Tharziel.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The room shimmered around him. It was time.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A pulse of light erased the room around him, fading away to the silent streets of a quaint city. The moon hung high in the air, illuminating the cold air with a soft light. The few pedestrians on the pavements held their jackets close to them, ignoring the other people around them as they made their swift way home. People that Tharziel would soon be corrupting.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But not tonight.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Tonight, he'd get used to this new body. Then he'll make his plans to spread his influence.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He needed a place to draw people to him. A place where the most susceptible, the most influenceable people would be attracted to. People with weak morals and carnal desires.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Tharziel examined his new, muscular body, glistening with a dark sheen under the pale yellow lamp post. He'd get to his scheming soon. For now, he had his body to attend to. He made his way down the pavement, disappearing into the soft, glowing lights of the city.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The bustle of the crowd filled the air of the huge room with a high domed ceiling. The dome was painted a deep and dark blue, filled with holographic constellations that came to life, prancing through the air across the celestial canvas. The floor was lined with glowing display panels, giving people the feeling of walking over the void of space as they made their way across the room. The service staff of the establishment, as well as some guests, were dressed in leather and rubber garb, giving the entire place a surreal air to it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wealthy people made their way around the lobby, some of them admiring the decor of the room, others simply making their way down to the next corridor.  Over the past year, the newly founded Silver Serpent Casino had gained popularity for its high-stakes gambling as well as its bondage-themed facilities. Each year, millions of people from all over the world would travel to this very casino, if not to gamble, then at least to peruse its bondage facilities.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>In the control room at the heart of the Silver Serpent were hundreds of screens lining the far wall of the dark and tall room. Each of them was streaming feed from the various rooms of the casino, from the game rooms to the numerous lobbies of the building, from the various facilities to the corridors of the Silver Serpent hotel built above the casino.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Watching them all was a white, arctic wolf seated in a plush, leather chair. He was wearing a black, slim-fitting tuxedo, tenting his fingers as his eyes moved from screen to screen intently.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was a soft chime of the doorbell. "Come in," the wolf called out in a gruff voice devoid of emotion. A rectangular hole in the smooth wall behind the wolf's chair faded away, forming a doorway that a blue-furred tern proceeded to walk through. He was dressed in a white business suit, strolling over to the wolf's heavy oak desk as the doorway solidified behind him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf turned his seat around to face the approaching tern.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Master Decro," he grinned.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yes," the wolf snorted, "What is it, Javek?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Just some operational updates, the usual," the tern shrugged casually, "Ready for them?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf nodded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So," Javek continued. "Visitor count has increased twofold over the past month. There's a hundred and sixteen percent increase in the number of membership conversions too, which is a great thing because our old one-off guests are coming back and committing to the casino. On top of that..." he rattled off more numbers and statistics from the top of his head as he rested his body weight on his arm on Decro's desk.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So," he finally wrapped up, "What do you think?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro nodded his head. "Very good," he complimented, "Let's keep this growth up."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh yes, and we have two more...'volunteers' going to be joining our workforce," he smirked, apparently pleased with himself.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"That is nice to hear, I can see you're excited," came the response.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"That I did, good sir," Javek tipped his imaginary hat at the wolf, "So you're gonna do that black aura thing where you spawn some tentacles and corrupt the shit out of them?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I only reserve that for the worst of the worst," Decro responded, "You know it's not good for people to know about these powers."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah wells, don't sweat yourself, sir," the tern shrugged. "More fun for me," he flashed a smug grin at the wolf.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Is there anything else?" Decro asked.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Nope, nope, that should be all," the tern said cheerily before turning around to leave. "Ta," he said in a cheery voice. The doorway opened up to let him through before materializing into solid wall again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro turned around to resume his position of watching the screens. The casino was growing and soon he'd leave the world thirsty for more. Slaves to their carnal cravings of the flesh. And he'd rule over them all.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ End ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
