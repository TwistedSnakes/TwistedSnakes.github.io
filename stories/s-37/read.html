A headache pounded the inside of his skull as he tried to get up.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Wait.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>This wasn't his room. As his vision cleared, the brown, banded mongoose looked around him. He was sitting on the dusty floor of an abandoned warehouse. Light streamed in from the grimy windows of the warehouse, illuminating motes of dust floating in the air. Half of the windows were broken, others boarded up with wooden planks nailed over their frames.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You're awake," a voice called out, interrupting his thoughts.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell spun around to see a blue wolf sitting cross-legged on the other side of the warehouse. As he moved, the sound of clinking metal around distracted him. There was a steel collar with a chain around his neck.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What's this?" he asked indignantly at the sight of the collar. "And who are you?" he turned angrily towards the wolf.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Name's Frosty," the wolf shrugged, nodding at a similar chain around his neck, "And don't look at me, I've got one too."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell turned to look at Frosty and saw that the wolf was indeed collared and chained. The chain snaked along the ground behind the wolf, leading to the internal roof of a glass tank that held together by a riveted metal frame. It was big enough to hold just one person if he were standing. Its ceiling and floor were made out of metal, but its four walls were made out of glass. The closest wall to them was open like a door, allowing the chain to connect the ceiling of the tank to Frosty's collar.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The mongoose turned around to see a similar contraption behind him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What's up with this?" he grunted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hey, slow down there," Frosty snorted, "Let's start with the introductions first. As I've said earlier, I'm Frosty, and you are...?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Maxwell," the mongoose responded, taking a deep breath as he tried to clear his mind of the confusion and frustration.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, nice to meet you then," the wolf gave up waiting for a further explanation as he remained seated on the dusty floor.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So what's this about? How did we get here?" Maxwell asked indignantly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Beats me," Frosty shrugged. "Walking down the street when suddenly," he slammed a fist into the palm of the other hand creating a loud smacking sound, "And then I wake up here. And you?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Don't know," the mongoose lied. He wanted out as soon as possible and this line of interrogation was going nowhere fast. "This doesn't answer why we're here, either," he changed the subject.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Try that cassette player then?" Frosty nodded towards a small rectangular device on the ground behind Maxwell, almost hidden by the shadows of the room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You didn't check this earlier?" Maxwell asked gruffly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Chain's too short," Frosty answered, unfazed by Maxwell's crude demeanour.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a grunt, the mongoose went over to the device and picked it up. A static sound began playing from it as he hit the "play" button on it, clearing up as a voice spoke through it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hello, Maxwell. I want to play a game," a deep, raspy voice announced, "Remember Emmanuel Alvarez?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell immediately pressed the "stop" button and the device went silent.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hmm?" Frosty raised an eyebrow.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"N-nothing," the mongoose tried to shrug it off nonchalantly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty got to his feet and took a few steps towards Maxwell until the chain went taut behind him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So, really," Frosty asked again, "Why are you here?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell glared at the wolf but didn't say a word.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You're going to have to play the tape anyway, and I'm going to hear everything it says. Might as well hear it from you first," Frosty reasoned.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The mongoose's eyes fell to the ground. He didn't want to have to face this. Not now, not ever. And especially not when he was kidnapped and locked away in an abandoned warehouse with another stranger.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He took a deep breath.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>This tape was their only clue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And it would reveal his dark secrets.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Better him than a voice recording explaining the situation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He took a deep breath again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fine."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fine," Maxwell repeated again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty silently watched the mongoose pace around in circles as he worked up the courage to talk. If he wanted to find out more, the best way to do it was to let Maxwell initiate it without prompting from Frosty's side.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fine, so about this Emmanuel. I used to call him Manny. He is, was, my...ugh!" Maxwell threw his hands into the air, "Where do I even begin?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He paced around the room again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So I'm a hitman, alright?" he glanced at Frosty to watch his reaction but the wolf seemed unperturbed. "And Manny," he continued, "he's my partner in the business. Helps me settle the logistics side of things. Makes sure everything's in place for the hit."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty nodded understandingly, a subtle nudge for Maxwell to continue, "And then we got caught. See, we weren't supposed to get caught. But Manny didn't do a background check on this contract. Or maybe he did, I don't fucking know. It was a setup, okay? A sting operation. And then we were caught."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Obviously I ratted him out. I wasn't going to take the fall for his mistakes. He can take the life sentence. Not me! The long story short, I told some lies, pull some strings, he's in jail now, and I'm here. Wherever 'here' is," the mongoose huffed, sighing as he finished, "So what, am I a monster to you now?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Maybe," Frosty gave a cold look. He half-wanted to say yes. That they were all monsters for being here in the first place. But if he wanted to keep the upper hand, he would have to play the next few steps carefully.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And if I'm here for Manny, then you've probably got some dirt on you too!" Maxwell challenged the wolf.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"No clue what you're talking about," Frosty scoffed indignantly, "I didn't do anything wrong."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Then why are you here then?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Still no idea, waiting for you to play that tape to give me that answer," the wolf snarled.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gah! Fine!" Maxwell pressed the play button again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The voice continued where it left off, "Your lies and deceit have made your best partner and closest friend take the punishment that was meant for you. But that was not enough for you. You wanted to silence the truth completely so you arranged for a gang inside the prison walls to stage a fight, getting Emmanuel killed in what was written off as an accident. You are a despicable one.."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty raised a suspicious brow at Maxwell who averted his gaze and ignored the wolf.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Today," the voice explained, "You will learn the meaning of cooperation or die trying. Around the warehouse are six keys, one of which will grant you freedom. But freedom does not come cheap. Each of them is guarded by a trap made out of weapons you have used in the past, except this time you will be on the receiving end.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The timer will start counting down two hours," the voice continued. As if on cue, a giant numerical display against a wall lit up with the numbers "2:00:00", counting down the seconds.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty and Maxwell turned to the timer with wide eyes before looking back to the cassette player as if they could make the voice speak faster through their sight alone.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"If you do not escape before the timer runs out, the chains will drag the both of you into your tanks where ice-cold water will fill up and freeze around you. Try to pull the collars off without unlocking it and you will face the same fate. Will you learn the value in partners or will you die alone? Make your choice."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What the fuck?" Maxwell yelled, "Which sick fucker came up with this?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"No clue. Let's work fast. I've taken a look at some of the traps earlier. They do not look good," Frosty explained.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What traps?" Maxwell snapped.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Those," he pointed out weird contraptions set up around the warehouse. Two of them were to his left and right, two were on either side of Frosty's tank, and two more were on either side of Maxwell's tank. "We can start with that one," Frosty suggested, pointing to the one on the left, just beneath the timer.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The both of them hurried over to the first contraption.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>If not for a label that said "Key" followed by a square that was crudely painted on the side of the machine, Maxwell would never have guessed it was a trap. It looked like it was part of a factory processing line. A chute made of thick, clear acrylic protruded out of its side, slanted down as if expecting something. It was long enough for a person's outstretched arm to reach through before barely touching the inside of the contraption.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The machine's sides where a control panel and opening were supposed to be were covered with a sheet of hard steel bolted down, making the chute its only opening. An arrow drawn in the same red paint pointed down the chute. That was where the key was.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Who's gonna do this?" Maxwell asked hesitantly after they've circled the machine a few times in careful examination.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The way I see it, it should be you. I haven't done anything wrong, but here I am in this trap to serve as your 'cooperation training'," Frosty said the last two words scathingly as he snorted towards the mongoose.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ugh, fine," he huffed, "Just reach into that and get the key inside?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"That's what it looks like," the wolf nodded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Here goes nothing then," the mongoose stepped up and reached his hand into the chute, peering into it as he watched his fingers crawl down the slanted chamber and into the darkness of the machine. He felt around the inside of the machine and within seconds the top of his hand bumped into something metallic, sending it swinging as if it hung from a string.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Feeling his way around, Maxwell reached up and grabbed the swinging object. It was a key suspended on a string. The darkness didn't give anything away; he couldn't see his own fist.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Found it," he huffed to the wolf.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yeah? Pull it out then," Frosty instructed, watching the mongoose with an intent but dispassionate look.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell turned back to the chute and got ready to pull.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">But...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell let go, pulling out his arm and jumping back from the machine as if it were trying to swallow up his arm.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What the!" he shouted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What's wrong?" Frosty raised his eyebrow in annoyance and impatience. The timer was down ten minutes as he gave it a glance.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I...I thought I saw a gun. It was pointed up the chute. At me!" he mumbled.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"A trap I'm guessing," the wolf rolled his eyes, "But we got to get it either way."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"But this machine is trying to kill us!" the mongoose argued back.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So are the others," Frosty snapped back, "Do you think this is a walk in the park? We do a fun little treasure hunt where we prance around the fields and look for easter eggs? And after you've found all six, then what, you get off scot-free for your murders? Wake up, Maxwell. This isn't a game."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty's words stung like a slap to the face. His ego didn't want to admit it but the wolf was right. This was meant to be a test and he needed to face it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He reached back into the machine, this time steering his head clear of the chute. His arm would be in the line of fire...but...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He didn't want to think about it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He pressed his arm close to the bottom of the chute as he reached for the key. Would the gun fire at him? Would he get hurt? Was this all just some elaborate prank? He sure hoped it was. But the timer continued its countdown and he didn't want to test that theory on the off chance that the voice would make good on his threats.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He took a deep breath.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And then he pulled hard.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Everything seemed to happen in slow motion. The string holding the key snapped as he yanked on it and there was a loud gunshot. There was a shot of pain coming from his knuckles and he let go of the key as he pulled his arm out. The momentum of the key carried it out of the chute and it dropped with a tinkling sound on the ground.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Argh!" Maxwell gasped in pain, panting as he grabbed his hurt hand. The pain and confusion made it hard to see anything.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Just a scratch," Frosty gave the wound a cursory glance before going over to pick up the key.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>In the meantime, the mongoose calmed down as he took a look at his knuckles. A streak of shiny, raw flesh was exposed, the skin and fur having been ripped off from the spin of the lead bullet. It could've been worse.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Doesn't work," Frosty grunted in annoyance and threw the key to Maxwell. The mongoose caught it in midair and felt for the keyhole in the collar. He slid it into the hole and it sat inside snugly but refusing to turn.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Wrong key then," Maxwell wanted to swear but he held his composure. His temper wasn't going to help them here. He examined the key for some sort of clue but there was only a square printed on it, matching the painted square beside the trap's label.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell turned from the key to look Frosty in the eye.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You do the next one."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The next contraption was marked with a hexagonal shape beside the word "Key". It was just slightly taller than them but spanned more than their arm spans combined. On each end were openings on the ground with conveyor belts leading into the machine but one end of it was bolted close with a metal plate. The other opening was marked by another painted arrow.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You're up," Maxwell reminded Frosty.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I know," the wolf retorted. Maxwell did the first one so it was only fair that he did the second. Besides, he couldn't come up with a reason to get out of it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty stepped onto the unmoving conveyor belt and bent down. The opening was just high enough for him to crawl into. The inside of the machine was dark, illuminated only by a thin slit of light let in by a gap between the other opening and the bolted plate.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Taking a deep breath, Frosty crawled into the opening. He made his way forward gingerly, his eyes and ears alert for signs of movement or anything that could be a trap.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He half expected something to shoot out at him and mortally wound him, but somehow he made it to the end unscathed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Where was the key?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He looked around, using whatever little light that was coming in through the slit to help him. His eyes fell on a painted arrow that pointed up. Lo and behold, above him was a key hanging from a string.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Deep breaths.</span><span> Was it excitement or fear? He didn't know.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But the previous trap was triggered by the key. He would be a fool to reach out and grab this one without some precaution. Frosty slowly and carefully got to his feet to take a look at the key. The string suspending it was loosely knotted around the key's circular hole meant for a keyring. If he were to hold the key in place as he undid the knot, he wouldn't have to pull on the string at all.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Steadying his shaking hands, Frosty held the ridged end of the key with his fingers. His other hand reached for the loose end of the string. If he pulled it out, the knot would come undone and the key would be free.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Deep breaths.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He slowly tugged on the string, undoing the knot. Suddenly, as the knot came undone, the tension in the string jerked it out of his hands. There was a click. Then something big swung at him from above.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His instincts taking over, Frosty ducked but he was too slow. The side of the object grazed the side of his head and the momentum threw him toward the metal wall of the machine. His temple hit the solid steel and everything went white. The impact of the swinging object hitting the metal wall filled the entire chamber with a gong sound as the wolf collapsed on the ground clutching his head in pain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It felt like his skull was cracked down the middle and pressure inside was just waiting to burst through the gaps. He squeezed his head together trying to contain it. Contain the agony within him. His breaths were laboured and his spit splattered on the ground with each exhalation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>How long had he been here? The gong continued to echo around him. Or was it just in his head? He couldn't tell anymore.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hello? Frosty? Still alive in there?" Maxwell's voice called into the machine.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty grunted in pain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Ugh...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The bright stars in his vision slowly faded away and his eyes fell on the key, lying on the conveyor belt where he dropped it. After picking it up, he looked above him. A heavy hammer was slowly swinging over his head and the metal wall beside the hammer was dented in. If his head was there...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He didn't want to think about it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Frosty. Hey," Maxwell called again, "Stay with me."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yeah, yeah," the wolf called back. Holding the key, he crawled out of the machine. Once he was safely out, he stood up unsteadily. He took the key and tried it on his collar. Nothing.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Here, you try," he held the key out to Maxwell, who took tried it on his own collar. It didn't work either. Grunting in annoyance, the mongoose handed it back to the wolf. Another round of efforts wasted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Forty minutes had already passed since the start of the timer.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fuck" Maxwell swore.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yeah..." Frosty grunted, rubbing the side of his head. "So there are two traps on my side, two on yours," he pointed to the two contraptions on either side of the room, "You're up next."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The mongoose felt a tinge of annoyance as he turned around to look at the traps, one on either side of the tank that could very well be his coffin. He picked the one on the left and made his way towards it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The contraption seemed simple. A clear L-shaped tunnel with the key at the end; he would have to reach his arm forward and down the bend to pick up the key. This would've been an easy task of not for the presence of rows of syringes that lined the first half of the tunnel. To reach the key, he would have to press his arm into the tips of the needles.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He shuddered to think about what was in those needles.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What are you waiting for?" Frosty prompted as he watched the mongoose hesitate, "Time is running out."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a hint of annoyance and reluctance, Maxwell nodded and reached his hand into the tunnel, leaving a wide berth between his arm and the needles. Once his hand was at the bend of the L, he slowly manoeuvred his arm, watching carefully as he reached down into the chamber where the key was sitting.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The key was still some distance away as he slowly lowered his arm. His upper arm was barely touching the tips of the needle but his fingers were nowhere close to the key.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He didn't have a choice. He'd have to let the needles pierce him. Taking a deep breath, he pressed his arm down, feeling dozens of needle tips break his skin and pump some kind of toxins into him. There was a burning sensation spreading up his arm and he gasped in pain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Fighting the spreading discomfort, he reached for the key. The needles pressed deeper into him, aggravating his agony. The toxins were slowly reaching his brain, making his vision swim. Trying to keep his focus, he felt around the glass chamber until his fingers grasped the metal of the key.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Holding on to it tightly, he slowly raised his arm, freeing it from the needles before pulling his arm out. It was just in time too, for the poison took a strong hold on his mind, making him drop the key and collapse on the floor as he held his head in anguish.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Are you okay?" he heard Frosty call for him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yes. No. Just...give me some time," he grunted, not sure if the wolf heard his reply.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Out of the corner of his swirling vision, he spotted a broken cassette player on the ground just a short distance away from him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Was it another set of instructions?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Careful not to give away his intentions, he unsteadily crawled towards the cassette player. It lay smashed on the ground as if someone threw it with force with the intention of destroying it. The cassette tape within it, however, laid intact among the pieces of broken plastic.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell hurriedly lowered the volume on his cassette player and slotted the tape into it and pressed play. The voice came out barely louder than a whisper, but the mongoose didn't want to risk Frosty overhearing this tape.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hello Frosty, I want to play a game," the same raspy voice whispered through the player.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">This was Frosty's instructions!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"For years you have got away with the murder of innocent lives, all of them for your own sick pleasure. It started with your colleague at work, making her death look like an accident. From there you committed murder after murder, some of them people you knew, some of them total strangers."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell took deep breaths as the pain in his system slowly subsided.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Today, you shall prove your will to live with your final victim. In front of you is Maxwell, a hitman who has, like you, taken countless lives in cold blood. There are keys in this room, each of them hidden behind traps. But none of them will unlock the collar; only through Maxwell's death will your collar unlock.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The timer will start counting down two hours. If you do not succeed in killing Maxwell before the timer runs out, the chain around your neck will drag you into your tank where ice-cold water will fill up and freeze around you. Trying to pull the collar off without unlocking it will subject you to the same fate. Let's put your will to live to the test."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was a click as the recording ended. Maxwell squinted his eyes suspiciously. Frosty had been lying to him about the key. Understandably so, seeing that the wolf had to get him killed in order to escape.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cooperation. Maxwell scoffed. Someone wanted to teach him a lesson in cooperation but instead, he was paired with someone whose salvation was to see him killed. How was that a lesson? Or was the point of this game to give him the experience of trying to cooperate with someone who would betray him?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He didn't like the sound of that. But if Frosty was going to betray him, he was going to play the same game back. He took a closer look at the key: it had a circle printed on its handle, but otherwise, it looked like the rest of the keys.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He tried the key on his collar. Nope, it was the wrong key.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hey. Are you done?" Frosty called again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Carefully standing up, Maxwell turned around to face Frosty. There was just a little over an hour of time left.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell took a deep breath.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"This key has your name on it."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Huh?" Frosty looked confused. There wasn't supposed to be a key for him. Not according to the instructions.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"This key," Maxwell repeated, this time slowing down as if he were talking to a child, "Has your name on it."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>This didn't make any sense. But if this was his way out, he'd take it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hand it to me," Frosty demanded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hmm, not quite yet," Maxwell responded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And why not?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"If you get the key, who's to say you won't run off and leave me here?" Maxwell reasoned, "Get my key and then we'll talk."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty's eyes darted around the room as he thought of a way around it. The only reasonable course of action was to do as Maxwell wanted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fine," he conceded. Time was running out and they had no time for petty squabbles. He made his way over to one of the contraptions on his side and examined it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>This contraption was in the form of a chamber the size of a telephone booth, marked at the top with a painted diamond. Its entrance was lined with numerous sword-like blades that crisscrossed each other, guarding the key within the chamber.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty would have to reach between the blades to get the key hanging in the middle.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The steel blades reflected the light from the grimy windows, threatening to tear at his skin and rip him to shreds. He had to be careful.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Gingerly, he stretched out his right arm between the blades. He could almost reach the key but his body was already touching the edge of the blades. He turned himself to face the side so that his right cheek was pressed against the metal.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty could almost grab the key. But almost wasn't enough. He needed to get closer. Steeling himself for the pain, he pressed himself against the sharp edges of the blade, letting them cut his skin.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gah!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Warm blood trickled through the cuts and down his face. Some of it dripped onto the blades, staining them red as he swung his arm, trying to get the hanging key.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He still wasn't far in enough. He inched his right foot forward, letting the razor-sharp blades push deeper into his wound.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hgnn..." he stifled his groans of pain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He could feel the blade press against his cheekbone as he pushed in deeper. And...yes! The key was in his hand.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He gently extracted himself from the contraption, dripping blood all over the right side of his face as he did so. Bits of his cut fur floated to the ground, blue stained fluff mixed with crimson stains. His face hurt, but he had the key.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As expected, the key had a diamond print on it. He tried it on his collar, only to be disappointed when it didn't unlock. But at least now he could get his key from Maxwell.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"This key has your name on it," Frosty declared. The right side of his face was marred by deep cuts than ran across his face, causing Maxwell to take a few steps backwards.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Regaining his composure, the mongoose pondered.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Was the game set up so that the keys had the owner's name on them? Or was it all supposed to be shapes?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Was Frosty deceiving to him?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He had no way of telling either since he was the first one to lie about Frosty's name on the key.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I don't trust you," Maxwell challenged.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What do you mean?" the wolf sneered, "It's here with me."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hand me the key to test that theory then," the mongoose demanded in response.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Not until you give me my key."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell shifted his feet. If he gave Frosty the key, the game would be up. He wouldn't get his key because the wolf would find out about his lie.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You know what," Maxwell squinted at the wolf, "I think you're telling me a lie."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Then why don't we trade-"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So," the mongoose interrupted, "I want you to get the other key from your side too."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What?! That's crazy!" Frosty protested. "And if I die, you won't get this key either. You know, the real key that has your real name on it," he reasoned, putting emphasis on the words "real".</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'll take that chance," Maxwell shrugged.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And how do I know that you're not lying about my name being on that key?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You don't. You trust that I did find a key with your name on it and that I now hold your life in my hands."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a roar of anger, Frosty took a few steps towards the mongoose, only to be held back by the collar around his neck as the chain pulled tautly. He turned to look at the chain with an expression of ire before turning back to Maxwell.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"If I find out that you're lying, you'll get it from me," he snarled.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell had to hold back his impulse to flinch as he glared at Frosty with a poker face.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fine by me," the mongoose lied.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty stole a glance towards the timer. They had thirty-five minutes left. Grunting, he stormed towards the other trap on his side.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The next contraption was a large metal box which was bolted to the wall at eye level. At the top of the box was a painted star, and beneath it was two holes: a large one about the length of his forearm, and another one a quarter of its size.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cautiously, Frosty peered through the large hole into the box. Within it, he could see barbed wire winding around its insides. However, no matter how he looked around, he couldn't see the key within.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty didn't like the thought of what the trap needed him to do but there wasn't a way around it. He'd have to put his head into the box to look for the key. Begrudgingly, he pushed his muzzle into the larger hole, careful not to catch his skin onto any of the barbed wire. Once inside, he took a look around, spotting the key in the corner of the box.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He would have to navigate his hand through the other hole and around the maze of barbed wire to reach the key.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">It looked simple enough...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf took a closer look around him. There was a rope circling the hole that his head was poking through, looping around to form some sort of...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">A noose!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Picking up the key would probably tighten the rope around his neck with no way out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gahh!" Frosty thought out loud. He was risking his life for the stupid mongoose.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell watched the clock countdown as he waited for Frosty.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Thirty minutes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>One could argue that thirty minutes was still plenty of time but with Maxwell's life on the line, thirty minutes was way too close for comfort.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The clinking of chains made him turn around to see Frosty rubbing his neck. His face was still bleeding although not as profusely as before.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Got the keys?" Maxwell asked threateningly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yeah. They're here," Frosty raised up his hand to show two keys.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hand them over and I'll pass you your keys," the mongoose demanded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'll pass you your keys after you give me mine," the wolf refused to concede.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, looks like you won't get your key then."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty rolled his eyes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Look, let's stand on opposite sides and put the keys on the ground. After that, we'll swap places and get our keys. Think you can manage that?" he asked Maxwell scathingly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fine," the mongoose agreed. He'd prefer more time to try the keys on his collar before Frosty figured out his ruse but he didn't exactly have a choice. He set the key down on the ground, making sure that the wolf did the same.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Following Frosty's lead, they circled each other to where the other person left the keys. Maxwell hastily stooped down and picked the two keys up, trying one of them on his collar.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You fucking liar!" he heard Frosty shout.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Before he could react, the wolf's weight was suddenly thrust against his back, throwing the mongoose off balance onto the ground and pinning him there.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'll kill you here and now!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty rained blows on Maxwell, aiming for the mongoose's temples and spine as he tried to kill his rival. Maxwell turned around, throwing Frosty off him as he tried to defend himself. The two of them fought on the ground, exchanging punches at their vital points in a show of aggression, each one trying to kill the other in a vicious battle to the death.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a swift motion, Frosty wrapped his arm around Maxwell's neck, trapping him in a chokehold. Maxwell flailed his arms, trying in vain to escape Frosty's hold. Without air, it was only a matter of time before he ran out of strength. If only...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Wait.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He tried to reach behind him, trying to make his way around until his fingers closed around a hard, metallic plate.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Frosty's collar.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He tugged hard against it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You can't break free, so don't even try," Frosty warned.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell ignored the wolf. He gave the collar another hard tug. And another. Anytime now...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Suddenly, there was a loud beeping sound as the chain around Frosty's neck jerked backwards.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What the-" Frosty gasped in surprise and confusion, letting go of Maxwell who quickly scrambled to safety.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The mongoose had tricked the collar into thinking that Frosty was trying to remove it. Now, it would retract back into the tank, pulling the wolf back with it to his death. Maxwell watched in morbid curiosity as Frosty frantically grasped at his collar.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"H-hey!" he pleaded, "Give me another chance!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He struggled against the chains, trying in vain to stop himself from being pulled backwards.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Come on! Please!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The chain refused to give, continuing their progress as it retracted into the ceiling of the tank. Frosty was now in the tank, kicking and screaming desperately.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Help! Help me please!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The glass door closed with an ominous boom, sealing him in the tank.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Let me out! I don't want to die like- ack!" he was interrupted as the chain lifted him off the ground, dangling him by his neck.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Water gushed through holes in the floor of the tank, filling it up. Frosty felt the icy-cold water bubble around his feet as he frantically kicked his feet. His fingers were at his neck, trying to give his windpipe some leeway to breathe.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Thankfully for him, the water level reached his waist, allowing him to somewhat swim and support himself so that he can breathe. But that was soon about to work against him. The water level rose up to his chest, shoulders, then up to the ceiling of the tank.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Submerged in the tank, Frosty held his breath in an attempt to survive for as long as possible. Escape was feeling less and less likely but he had to try. Without warning, nozzles around the tank sprayed jets of cold air against the glass. Almost instantaneously, the water in the tank started to freeze over.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty could feel the solidifying ice creep over his legs. He kicked his feet, breaking the shards of ice for a brief respite. But the ice was relentless in its spread, gradually surrounding his feet and abdomen until his lower body had no space left to move. It hardened around his legs, encasing him in its solid prison.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Cold...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">So cold...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Frosty shivered. Partly from the cold, partly from the hopelessness he was feeling. He wrapped his arms around his chest and leaned forward, trying to conserve his body heat as the freezing ice spread upwards, encasing his chest.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He looked out of the tank through the glass for any bit of hope that he could cling on to, but there was nothing. The rest of the tank froze over, keeping him in his pose as he watched the world through his unmoving eyes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The cold ice around him was getting painful. Even shivering to keep warm was no longer an option for him. His mind wanted to retreat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Retreat into someplace warm.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But he had to focus. He needed to hold on.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His consciousness was gradually fading away. His vision slowly blurring. It was getting hard to hang on. Just a little break...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His mind slipped into a deep sleep, escaping the cold world around him for the last time.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell stared transfixed at Frosty's demise. Only when the wolf's body was fully frozen solid in the block of ice did he realize he was not out of the woods yet. The timer, now at fifteen minutes left, was still counting down for him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He tried on both keys that Frosty left behind. The first key didn't work. He hoped for the best as he tried the second key. And...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Nothing. It was the wrong key.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>That left him with the sixth and final trap. He made a dash for the last trap on his side. This one had a triangle painted on top of another factory machine. Like one of the previous contraptions, this one had all but one of its openings boarded up, requiring Maxwell to crawl into it to reach the key inside.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There wasn't a lot of time left. Without hesitation, the mongoose jumped onto the raised conveyor belt and crawled in, feeling his way around in the dark. He could feel some kind of metal grill beneath his palms and shins. While it was uncomfortable, his mind was focused on finding the key.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It wasn't lying on the floor. It wasn't stuck against the wall. Where was it?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Suddenly, Maxwell's muzzle touched a cold piece of metal dangling in front of his face. Without thinking, the mongoose pulled down on it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was the sound of a metal mechanism clicking and almost immediately, long metal spikes pierced through the gaps between the grill. There was a flash across Maxwell's vision as some of the spikes pierced his body. One impaled him through his torso and another through his right forearm, holding him in place as he instinctively tried to bend over in pain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"F-fuck..." he gasped, almost dropping the key as he tried to assess the damage. He didn't want to die here. Not when the last key was in his grasp. Using his free hand, he grabbed the spike that ran through his abdomen, feeling his warm blood trickling down its shaft. The spike had pierced his flesh, narrowly missing his spinal cord as it came out the other side.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Groaning as he mustered his strength, he slowly pulled the spike away from him. His adrenaline was holding back the pain as he slowly made progress.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Just a bit more...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a clang, the spike fell back between the gaps of the grill, releasing his torso. Careful not to further aggravate his wounds, he lifted his left hand until it was free of the spike piercing it. He clutched his stomach wound as he cautiously backed out of the contraption into the cool, outside air.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There were five minutes left. Trying to push away the pain that was threatening to render him unconscious, he tried on the key.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>This one should work. After all, the other five keys didn't.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Nothing.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was the wrong key.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What the?!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He tried the key again to the same effect. It was the wrong key. Trying to keep his cool, he ran over to the spot where he left the other keys. There was the square key from the first trap, the circle key from the third. He traded the circle for the diamond key and the hexagon key...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wait.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The hexagon key was from the second trap. That meant that Frosty never did the fifth trap.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He had been tricked!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck," he swore.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Three minutes left.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He tried to make a run for the trap that Frosty didn't complete but the chain stopped him in his tracks.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gah!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Two minutes left.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He had to do something. Clutching his abs, he hobbled over to one of the contraptions, prying a loose pole free from it. With his makeshift weapon, he went over to the glass tank and tried to break it apart.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The glass cracked with the first hit but didn't shatter. He tried again. And again. The tank's metal frame wasn't going to give so easily. He threw the pole onto the ground and ran back to where the keys were.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Come on, come on," he muttered to himself, trying on all the keys again. The first...no. The second...also no.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Thirty seconds left.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The other keys didn't work either.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fuck, no! Please! I don't want to die!" he pleaded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The countdown timer hit zero.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With an ominous clang, the chain mechanism began to reel Maxwell in.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"No, please! Help!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The mongoose was forced to stand up and take a few steps backwards as the collar pulled him into the tank. He kicked his legs and pulled against the collar, fighting frantically for his life. But the chain wasn't about to let him go. Within the next few seconds, he was pulled into the tank.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The collar lifted him up so that he was suspended by his neck, just like Frosty was only mere minutes ago. His hands clawed at the collar on his neck as he kicked his legs as if trying to tread on the air.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His abs were screaming in pain as his wound felt as if it was going to tear apart at the tissues. His mouth was open, trying to swallow the much-needed oxygen.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The water!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The water would give him some respite.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The doors to the glass tank slowly swung shut. Suddenly, the metal pole that he brought over was sitting at the entrance, jamming the door and keeping it open. Water gushed into the tank but instead of filling it up, it spilt all over the dusty factory floor.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>No!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell wasn't ready. He wasn't ready to die like this. His entire body weight was supported by his windpipe, compressing it to the point that he couldn't breathe. His jaw was wide open, gasping for air that wouldn't come. His arms and legs were flailing, more from instinct than from trying to escape. Cold jets blasted from the nozzles on the ground, chilling the air around him with sub-zero temperatures.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Help!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Please!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Anyone!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He needed a miracle. His vision was slowly blurring. He couldn't hang on for much longer. Black spots started dancing over his eyes, slowly growing bigger until he wasn't sure if his eyes were open or closed. His hangs hung limply at his sides and his legs were no longer flailing.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His burning lungs, however, continued to fight. His wrists twitched a little but otherwise, his body was hanging slack.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">He...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">...had to fight...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Maxwell jerked awake with the remaining energy he had. His shivering arms clasped at his collar, already unable to support himself. The frigid air was making it hard to focus. Through his swimming vision, he could barely make out shapes through the frosty glass. A figure was standing in the middle of the warehouse, wearing a black hoodie and an eerily painted mask.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You!" he wanted to shout accusingly but he was barely hanging on to dear life. He could have sworn that the person was smirking at him as his eyes closed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He could barely make out the sounds around him. There was the faint sound of police sirens.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Was help coming?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He opened his eyes to find the mysterious figure gone. Just a bit more. If he could stay alive until someone found him, he could be saved.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But his will to live was slowly fading away with the last of his strength. His body swung back and forth as the last of the cold jets subsided, leaving his corpse there for the police to discover.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ End ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
