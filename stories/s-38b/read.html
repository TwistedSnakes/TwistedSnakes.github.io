He goes in to find his suspicions correct: the Silver Serpent is turning people into service drones. However, he gets kidnapped. A rubber mask with a tube gag is forced over him, and a latex sleeve is glued over his dick. A chastity plate secures his rubber cock in his slit. A vibrator within teases him to orgasm. He's then suited in a latex suit, strapped in a straitjacket, and dildo-tipped tubes plug his mouth and ass. Electrical shocks keep his muscles stimulated as he's kept in a storage sleepsack, ruthlessly teased for six months.\nAvon is then released from his straitjacket, forced into a metal frame that keeps him on all fours like a feral animal, and locked in place. A blindfold stops him from seeing as he is set up as a public fucktoy. He gets penetrated from both ends, unable to orgasm with his chastity plate. Between breaks, he is fed a nutrient solution through a dildo that's pushed into his mouth.\nMeanwhile, a government official is talking to Decro, the owner of the Silver Serpent. It is revealed that Decro sponsors the state, and the government is afraid that Avon's actions have caused a tension between them. Decro, however, accepts the official's apology. The official offers to allow the Silver Serpent to keep Avon, and they leave him as a permanent sex toy.", "commissioners": ["UnderWraps"], "authors": ["TwistedSnakes"], "illustrators": [], "tags": ["male", "solo", "gay", "female", "male/male", "female/male", "villain/victim", "villain", "victim", "dragon", "orca", "setting - Silver Serpent", "bondage", "latex", "latex suit", "muzzle", "gag", "dildo gag", "chastity", "null bulge", "milking", "stimulation", "orgasm denial", "adhesive", "electro-torture", "spit-roast", "statue", "life support", "humiliation", "public play", "permanent", "forced", "non-consent", "bad end"], "display_tags": ["Setting - Silver Serpent", "Villain - Female orca", "Victim - Male dragon", "Top - 2x male", "Bottom - Male dragon", "Muzzle", "Dildo gag", "Null bulge", "Permanent chastity", "Orgasm denial", "Electro-torture", "Living statue/sex toy", "Spit-roast", "Non-consent", "Bad end"], "data": {}, "is_listed": true};

Yet this didn't seem to be a concern to the crowds as they streamed in and out of the modern-looking building. Brightly-coloured spotlights were waving across its curved walls, twisting and turning like braids as it reached for the sky. Its walls were made up of smooth white concrete and huge glass panes, making its colossal form look sleek and graceful in the backdrop of the night.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The driveway leading up to the building entrance was lined with limousines, each waiting their turn to drop off their wealthy passengers. The rest of the building's perimeter was surrounded by exquisite gardens and swimming pools. Glass cages with exotic feral animals stood at various intervals around the compound. None of these seemed out of place to the numerous guests as they swam in the pools and walked down the marble paths amongst the feral jaguars, bears, and elephants.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sneaking among the guests was a grey dragon in a blue tuxedo, blending in with the rest of the people. Avon was here on a mission. Out of all the missing cases his department at the police station had to handle, one in ten was linked to the Silver Serpent Casino. Perhaps they were staying at the hotel built just above the casino, or they have had a membership there for years. Either way, this place was connected to them.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Yet whenever he brought up this point to his superiors, they would wave him off, saying that he was imagining things and that he should focus his efforts on something more productive. The last straw came when he presented his boss with a printed stack of research he had done. Instead of giving it a look, his boss tossed the entire stack into the trash.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"This is a waste of company time!" he had yelled, "We've told you again and again: the Silver Serpent is on the right side of the law. I don't want you to ever bring up this subject again, do you hear me?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Today, though, Avon would prove his boss wrong. He would gather irrefutable evidence that the Silver Serpent was responsible for the numerous disappearances that have happened in the area. Perhaps then his superiors would take him seriously.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For now, though, he would have to be vigilant. His miniature camera was strapped around his wrist, ready to take photos of anything incriminating that might be lying around. A voice recorder was tucked into his vest pocket, recording the surrounding conversations as he made his way into the building.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The entrance led into a grand lobby decorated with an ancient-Rome-like aesthetic. Hotel staff walked around in white togas and service slaves followed their assigned guests around wearing only loincloths.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Avon had no time to be distracted though. He had to look for evidence of illegal activity but he had no clue where to look. If there were any evidence of Silver Serpent's criminal activity laying in plain sight, it would've been seen by its many patrons by now. Unless...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He watched as a staff member took a stack of paperwork from the lobby desk and bring it to a blank wall. A beam of light scanned the lizard and the wall disappeared, letting him step through it before the wall rematerialized.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>That must've been the entrance to the staff quarters, or at least one of them. Considering the size of the building, there must have been easily a hundred or more scattered around the compound.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Avon strolled over to where the hidden entrance was, casually examining it up and down as he tried not to raise suspicions of the staff or other guests. There was no way he could trick the identity scanner to open the way up, but he could resort to sneaking in behind a staff member.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Thankfully, he did not have to wait long for that. Within a few minutes, there was a soft whir as the blank wall faded away and the same lizard came out from the doorway. Without alerting the staff member, Avon swiftly stepped through the entryway before it faded into solid stone again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He found himself in a clean, white corridor. Its minimalistic design seemed to contrast the extravagant embellishments of the guest spaces. More importantly, though, he was one step closer to finding evidence. Doorways were marked on the walls with glowing outlines, working by the same mechanism as the staff entrance.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Choosing a random direction, the grey dragon made his way down the corridor, backtracking only when he heard someone coming from the opposite direction. His heart started beating faster as he saw an open doorway. He sped up towards it and peered into it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The doorway led into an observation room with a glass window but what caught his attention was the room behind the window. A dark-feathered raven was strapped onto a metal table with leather restraints, struggling to get out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Avon dashed in and went up to the window and tapped on it. The raven noticed him and called out to him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Please! Help!" he pleaded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragon hurriedly used his camera to snap a few pictures of the scene before looking around for a way to open the door to the other room. Another identification scanner; there was nothing he could do.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Wait! No! Stop! Please! I can pay it back!" the raven was shouting.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A sleek, metal helmet was lowered by a robotic arm over the struggling raven, locking in place over his head. Words began to display on the visor.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"N-no...please...let me go..." the raven's resolve seemed to falter. His body stopped pulling against the restraints as he laid limply on the rack.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hey, are you okay?" Avon called out to the raven, "Stay with me."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I...must obey..." the raven mumbled, "H-help...please!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Huh?" the dragon was confused.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Wait...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">The raven was getting brainwashed!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>More robotic arms swooped over the raven's body, stretching sheets of rubber over his body and heat-sealing it into a seamless latex suit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Shit."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">They were turning him into one of the service drones!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">And that's where the missing people are going!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The pieces of the puzzle were falling into place. Avon quickly took more pictures of the raven as the poor victim was slowly dronified.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hang on, I'll come back for you," Avon told the raven who was already oblivious to the world around him. He turned around to head for the doorway but someone was standing in his way of escape. Two burly rhinos in guard uniform were standing on either side of a blue-furred tern, dwarfing him in size. The tern was wearing a slim business suit as he smirked at Avon.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, look what we have here?"</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Avon woke up to find himself strapped face up to a similar metal table in a clean and white laboratory. The side of his head where the rhino had knocked him out in the scuffle was still aching. He was stripped of all his clothes, along with his camera and voice recorder.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Gahh! His evidence!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But he had other matters to worry about. He tested the black leather restraints that bound his wrists, waist, ankles and wings to the table but they didn't give. What were they holding him here for?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A whirring sound drew Avon's attention to the opening doorway. The tern from earlier entered the room, alone this time.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What do you want from me?" Avon asked angrily. Peering at the tern, he could see a name badge that read "Javek Feathertail".</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I should be asking you, Avon," Javek spoke with a smug air about him, "For what reason would a law-enforcing cop like you be breaking into our fine — and very much law-abiding — establishment? Taking pictures of our confidential processes no less."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Don't play games with me, I just saw what you were doing to that raven!" Avon tugged against his bonds as he retorted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh, that? Don't worry about that. I assure you that the process was a hundred percent legal," the tern replied. "And consensual," he added in response to the dragon's sneer.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"That was definitely not legal!" Avon protested.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, I can't force you to believe something, even if it is the truth," the tern shrugged.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"If it's legal, then you wouldn't mind me taking the photos back to the station then," the dragon reasoned.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I don't think so," Javek replied, "While we're not concerned about the legal implications of these pictures, they would be very bad for our public image."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fine..." Avon grumbled. But for now, he still needed to get out of this place, ideally without any legal repercussions of his trespassing. "What do you say you let me go and I forget everything I've seen in here?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I don't think so. Your actions today constitutes breaking and entering, and for a cop that is quite a serious offence, don't you think so?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Avon stayed silent, furrowing his brow in annoyance.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Anyway, I have other plans for you." Javek leaned over the bound dragon with a menacing grin, "I'm sure it'll sate your curiosity as to what goes on behind the scenes."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"No! Let me go!" Avon protested, struggling again in vain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Javek ignored him as he turned for the exit. A female orca was coming in through the doorway and the tern nodded at her.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'll let Nell take care of you," he said without looking at Avon as he waved his hand in the air nonchalantly, "You'll be useful to the Silver Serpent soon."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Nell stood over the restrained dragon, peering over his struggling form.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Stop!" Avon pleaded, "You don't have to do this!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I know," she grinned smugly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Avon growled as he tried to pull himself free. Was he going to be brainwashed just like the raven?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Nell trapped in a display that was supported by a metal arm attached to the ceiling and a panel in the wall opened up, revealing a row of black rubber gear.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You can't brainwash me," he lied, "I've been trained to resist this."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh, don't worry," the ocra smirked as she picked out a draconic muzzle, "I don't intend to brainwash you. You'll get to experience every moment of your new life."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Before Avon could react, the rubber mask was shoved over his muzzle, silencing him. A hollow tube in the muzzle kept his jaw open as he felt around it with his tongue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Awrgh?" he mumbled through the gag.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'll keep it a surprise," Nell teased as she picked up a black sleeve of some sort. With the fingers of her free hand, she pressed against his sensitive crotch slit, gently massaging its opening.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ghgnn..." the dragon tried to stifle his moans of pleasure. His member was slowly getting harder and harder within his increasingly restrictive slit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Ugh...this was neither the time nor place to be aroused.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The ocra, however, didn't seem to mind as she worked her fingers and gently pried the rigid cock out. Avon whimpered as his manhood was standing on display for the orca to appreciate.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>After putting on a latex glove, she squeezed a generous amount of a clear, slick liquid onto the erect shaft, smearing it all over his dick as she held him off with firm motions.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mghfftt!" Avon whined helplessly as he tried to hide his blushing. Despite his embarrassment, he was incredibly aroused. His involuntary hip thrusts only served to give himself away.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Before he could climax, Nell slipped the latex sleeve over his member, smoothing the rubber out over the entire length of the shaft and pressing it over his shafts.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Worried yet?" the orca smirked at the bound dragon as she watched the bound dragon's confused expression, "Because that rubber sleeve is glued on and it's not coming off anytime soon."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hfnng?" Avon panicked as he tugged against the leather bonds.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">What were they doing to him?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Ignoring the dragon's squirms, Nell gave the rock-hard cock a strong squeeze as her other hand passed the lips of his slit open. Avon whimpered as the orca directed the rubber dick back into his slit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His shaft, however, was too aroused to stay in his slit. But before his member could emerge, Nell stood a metal-plate-like device into the opening and pressed a button.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Almost immediately, the device opened up. Metal clamps pressed themselves against the sensitive walls of his flesh and gripped the erect shaft of his cock.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Chastity device," Nell smirked, "You won't be getting off, not without our permission."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ghhfm!" Avon cried helplessly. His mind was struggling to process the bizarre things she was doing to him, much less figure out the reason for all these...modifications to his body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"But if you obey us, it'll make things easier for you," Nell continued, "In fact, I daresay you'll find it...pleasurable."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As she tapped on the display beside her, the rubber sleeve encasing Avon's useless dick started vibrating. She played around with the intensity, increasing it as the dragon seemed to get used to the stimulation and decreasing it as he got too close to the edge. Without even thinking about it, his hips were humping the air as if his cock was free to thrust into a tailhole in front of him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Want to cum?" the ocra purred.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Nfft!" he conceded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Not convincing enough," she teased as she lowered the intensity.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Nfft!" he mumbled through the gag again, gingerly nodding his head.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You're desperate, aren't you? Show it in your actions," Nell grabbed his crotch, rubbing her palm up and down the inutile bulge that used to be his slit. "I want you to beg."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Avon shook his head. He wasn't going to beg. He was a dignified cop on a mission. Not a horny slut pleading for the chance to cum.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For more pleasure to stimulate his trapped cock.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For the tension to go away.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'm waiting."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Plrrh lftt mfft chmm!" he begged, thrashing his head from side to side as he humped the air in front of him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Good slave," Nell grinned as she set the rubber sleeve to milking mode.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The sleeve started squeezing and kneading Avon's cock, making him feel like he was getting massaged by skilful hands. It went up and down his length, pumping and milking him in anticipation of his orgasm.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gnfrrt..." his eyes rolled back in pure bliss as the rubber sleeve worked him over. Nell watched the dragon as his dignity gave way to his libido. The dragon was struggling against the table; this time not as an attempt to escape but as a primal response to a climax that was coming.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Avon didn't care. His mental focus could only latch onto his deep need for release. His cock was trapped against the metal plate, imprisoned within his own fleshy slit. He had no way of pleasuring himself. But this, this would be his reprieve from the tension that was building up.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He continued to thrust his hips, grinding the air like there was no tomorrow. He could feel it coming. Just a little more...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hggnnn!" with a loud moan, Avon shot his load in his slit, rocking his hips with each spurt. The slit in the tip of the cock let his cum escape, seeping out of his quivering slit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Heh, look at you," she teased as she wiped up the cum with a cloth, "Cumming like the slut you are with no cock to show for it."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Avon whimpered as his sense of reasoning came back to him, accompanied by his embarrassment and shame. His sticky slit felt dirty inside him as he laid limply on the rack.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Nell, however, was not done with him. He was suited up in a sleek, futuristic-looking rubber body suit. He didn't resist as she released his wrists and ankles to pull the suit over his body. After all, there was no way he could escape. Even if he had managed to release his neck, he wouldn't make it past the door's identification system.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>All he could do was watch helplessly as the rubber suit was pulled over his body, hugging his form as it brought out his curves in the reflection of the room's lights.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You look very sexy," Nell purred as she stroked his rubber-encased form, paying extra attention to the metal-sealed bulge at the dragon's crotch, "Our guests will be craving for your body soon." </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"But for now, you're still too feisty to use so I'm going to put you into Deprivation until you're ready," the orca explained as she put Avon into a straitjacket, strapping it tightly so that he could barely move his arms.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Deprivation?</span><span> Avon didn't like the sound of that.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But there was nothing he could do about it as Nell zipped up his wings into a tight latex sheath, strapping it down with leather straps so that his wings were pressed against his back. The tip of his tail was secured to the collar of his suit and his knees were bent back and strapped into place so that his ankles were pressed against his firm buttcheeks.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Now for life support..." Nell mumbled as she drew two tubes from the ceiling. One of them was secured to the chastity device in his slit and it immediately began sucking away his residual seed in him. The other tube had a rubber attachment in the shape of a knotted cock. Finding the opening in the back of the suit, the orca pressed the rubber dildo into the dragon's tailhole.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Avon whimpered and squirmed as the rubber phallus invaded his body. Before he could squeeze out the intruder, Nell had already secured the attachment to his suit. The tubes would serve as a means to clear away his waste while he was in storage.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Another dildo-tipped tube was shoved into the tube bag around his mouth to serve as a feeding tube, screwed into place to secure it there.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"A month to two should be enough for you," Nell purred as she caressed the bound and struggling dragon, "What do you think?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gnrft mrtfh!" Avon protested.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I knew you'd agree," the ocra smirked, "That's why we've thought of everything."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She tapped on the controls and pain shot through Avon's body as the suit discharged a burst of electricity into his body from metal nodes within it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"This will help stimulate your muscles and prevent atrophy," she explained as another shock caused him to jerk in his bonds again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft!" he whined.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh, not strong enough for you? I can bring it up a few notches."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The next shock hit Avon like he was being smashed straight into a wall as his body shook against the metal table.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hnfft!" the dragon gasped in pain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Nell smirked as she lowered the current until the grey dragon was left quivering on the table. The orca released Avon's restraints as a black body bag suspended on ceiling rails descended beside them. With a heave, Nell lifted the dragon, moved him into the bag, and began zipping up the heavy steel zipper around him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gnrft!" Avon protested as the bag was quickly closed around him. Nell peered into the bag, watching his fearful and desperate eyes search in vain for a means of escape as she pulled the zip closed, plunging the dragon into darkness.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Inside the bag, the dragon could feel his body being lifted up with the bag by the metal rails. The sound of a spinning motor started up and he was guided by the rails away from the room.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He had no idea how long he had been in Deprivation. He had been kept in a state of being half-asleep from the loss of his senses, half-awake from the electrical shocks that had kept his body shivering. Every few hours, a nutrient paste would flow down the tube and into his mouth. There was no way he could resist as the gag freed the way for it to go down his throat to sustain his bound body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">And the stimulation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Oh, the stimulation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Since he had been kept here, the cock sleeve in his slit had been relentlessly buzzing against his member, keeping him on the edge but never aroused enough to climax. Each session of milking would fill his slit with pre but deprive him of the opportunity to cum.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Surely someone at the station would've noticed he was missing by now. Perhaps they would send a team into the Silver Serpent and find him. Then they'd see that they've been wrong and that he had been right this whole time.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But he didn't leave behind any leads. Nobody knew that he was sneaking into the Silver Serpent. Not even a note on his work desk could hint to his colleagues as to his whereabouts.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">How could he be so stupid?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But his thoughts slowly drifted to his throbbing cock still imprisoned within his slit. His limbs were bound and helpless to even stroke his damp slit for some form of reprieve from the tension. Instead, he settled for humping the canvas of the bag around him, rubbing his sensitive scales through the latex suit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Without warning, there was a jerk and his body started swinging about. The bag was moving along the rails, dragging him to someplace else. Were they letting him out? Based on what he had seen here, the chances were slim.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Still, anything was better than being stuck in that dark limbo.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Right?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He came to an abrupt stop as he came to the end of the rails. The bag was unceremoniously dropped onto the ground and unzipped, allowing Avon to have a breath of fresh air. The brightness around him blinded him as he tried to get accustomed to using his eyes once again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As the dragon's vision cleared and he looked around, he saw a familiar-looking orca and a burly bear standing over him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I must say, I almost forgot about you," Nell grinned, "You've been in Deprivation for almost six months now." She waved it off as if she had just been making a casual joke.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Six months?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But the time didn't seem to matter. Right now, he'd do anything for respite from the incessant electric shocks and for release from his denied stimulation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The vibrations and shocks were turned off as the bear released his tail and leg restraints before moving on to remove his straitjacket. Avon slowly stretched his limbs, getting a feel of them after months of not using them.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His mouth, crotch, and tailhole tubes were removed, finally freeing him of the system. All that was left on him was his rubber suit, muzzle gag, and the bothersome device within his slit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Gahh!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His slit quivered from his arousal, leaking liberal amounts of clear pre over the floor. His throbbing cock was pressed firmly against the warm metal chastity plate, tightly imprisoned by both the metal and the walls of his slit. He desperately wanted, no, needed release. What he would give for even the slightest chance to orgasm like this, chastity device and all.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But his desires were none of the Silver Serpents concern. Taking no heed of the dragon's helps whimpers, the bear carried him over to a strange metal frame. Solid metal strips ran across and over the shape of a feral dragon on all fours, welded together to form two halves of a hard shell.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Was he going to be shoved into that contraption?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Apparently so, for the bear pushed Avon into its form, forcing him to be on all fours. Through the haze of his arousal, Avon squirmed to escape but the bear's grip was firm. The other half of the metal cage was closed around him and locked into place.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragon winced from the discomfort. The metal frame was extremely form-fitting, pushing against his scales and latex skin as it forced him to be on his fours as if he were a feral dragon crouching down. His tail was bent against his back and his wings were open and raised. His head was locked in place, allowing him to only see objects in front of him. If one gave him a cursory glance, one could have mistaken him for a statue of a dragon taking flight.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His form was lifted up and put onto a trolley. His eyes darted back and forth as he was wheeled out of the staff area and into the Silver Serpent. He was taken to a purple-lit room where guests were dressed only in latex and leather underwear as they lounged around, checking out each other's sculpted bodies and defined bulges.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As the bear set him onto the ground, the orca connected a tube to his slit plate to keep him clean.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You new job," Nell purred as she pulled out a blindfold and wrapped it around his eyes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">His new job? What was it?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As if she was answering his thoughts, she teased, "It'll be a surprise."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Avon could hear her and the bear's footsteps moving away, leaving him alone. The cool air against his mouth and open tailhole made him feel vulnerable in his immovable state.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His worst fears were realized as he heard the footsteps of someone stepping up to him. The scent of another fur's manhood filled his nose.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">He was set up as a sex toy!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Heh, this one looks like he's eager," a gruff voice said.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mgrft!" Avon whimpered in fear. He wasn't eager at all but there was no way of telling that to the fur in front of him. A firm cock was guided into his open gagged mouth, allowing him to taste the entirety of the member in his mouth. At the same time, his cock sleeve began vibrating again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gnffht hgnr!" he mumbled. His pleas were muffled by the wide girth of the phallus as it spread the rubber tube, forcing his jaws apart. The hips of his unknown user began thrusting, repeatedly filling his maw with warm flesh.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was essentially getting raped and there's nothing he could do about it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Another fur began nudging his tapered cock against Avon's tailhole. Acting on his instincts the dragon tried to pull down his tail in self-defence but it was secured in place by the frame.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">He had never felt so helpless in his life!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The phallus in his tailhole began thrusting in and out, making sure that the dragon was fully utilized in both ends.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mgght!" his muffled whines could barely be heard over the moans of his two users.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Without warning, the sleeve began milking him for all he was worth. If he weren't locked into his body frame, his knees would've buckled. Instead, all he could do was squeeze his knees together as he trembled in his fixed pose. He was filled with a mixture of pain and pleasure, embarrassment and euphoria.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The more he was used, the more the cock sleeve would stimulate him. His pre was leaking through the edges of the device, seeping out of his slit as it pooled on the plinth that he was bolted to.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His quivering slit was accentuated by the curves of his shiny latex suit. Pressed against the metal was his useless cock, desperately eager but trapped all the same in the prison of his slit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">If only he could just grind his hips against something!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was panting for release between each thrust of the dick in his mouth. Just a bit more and he'd get to cum.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With loud moans, both his users climaxed, spilling their generous load into his mouth and pucker.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gnfr!" Avon groaned. He felt dirty but that was the least of his concerns. With his maw and tailhole empty, the cock stimulation which he had been enjoying ground to a halt, depriving him of his own climax. His pre-cum dripping from his rubber crotch only served to remind him of how close he was to his long-denied release.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Would he ever get to cum? Or would his chastity deny him orgasm again and again?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Two more furs stepped up, getting ready to use the sex slave put on display.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">He'd find out soon enough.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A latex-suited dragon was trembling in the metal frame in one of the many Sex Lounges located all around the Silver Serpent. Cum was dripping from both his mouth and his tailhole, having been filled again and again with the seed of horny patrons looking for release. Unfortunately for him, he was denied each and every climax of his own as he felt others take pleasure in climaxes of their own.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Just as the Silver Serpent was open and bustling every moment of the day, Avon got no rest from his job as a fuckhole. The only he breaks he had were the time it took for one user to extract himself from the dragon's hole and another to take his place. Each fucking he took came and went in a hazy blur through his sleepy mind.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Feeding time," the voice of a staff member called. A rubber dildo was pushed into his mouth gag and a sweet-tasting nutrient solution was pumped down his mouth and into his throat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfftg hgnn wrhh..." he pleaded to the staff member for mercy. Anything to be free from his predicament.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And...we're done," the staff member didn't seem to have understood the dragon as he packed up and left the slave in the hands of the next patron.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gwrrh!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Time had long lost its meaning for him as he tried to hold on to every bit of sanity he had left. A part of him wanted to try and fight. Perhaps someone would recognize him and report it to the cops. But another part of him wanted to just give up and surrender to whatever they had in store for him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Wouldn't that be easier?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mgnn..." he mumbled in defeat as another cock entered his loose tailhole. Since he had been captured by the Silver Serpent, it felt like his entire life had been forfeit. Everything beyond that felt like a faraway dream. His quiet apartment in the suburbs. His steady job as a police officer.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Were they still looking for him?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Should he even be hoping at this point in time, when all it led to was only more disappointment?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Another patron entered his mouth, lubricated by both his saliva and the cum from his previous user. The resultant wave of stimulation and milking distracted his thoughts, clouding his sleepy mind with the colours of euphoria.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was only leaking pre-cum now, but someday he'd get to cum.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">Someday.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"We're deeply regretful of the trouble our employee has caused you, Mr Castor," the shark bowed in his leather seat apologetically.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was dressed in a smart business suit that seemed to be tailored to every curve of his body, bringing out his muscular form as he moved. Sitting across him was an equally-sharp arctic wolf. His suit was jet-black, contrasting his silver-blue eyes that watched the shark with a vivid intensity. He held about him an air of confidence that the shark seemed unsure and even afraid of. The both of them were in a huge lounge that was dimly-lit but grandly furnished.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf picked up a cup of strong tea from the glass coffee table between them and took a sip from it before putting it back down, taking his own time as he did so.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Let's do away with the formalities; you can call me Decro," he waved his hand, leaving a trail of dark aura in its wake.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Alright," the shark bowed again. "I understand that our employee, Avon, has been caught trespassing on your premises a year ago. So..." he seemed unsure as to how to continue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah, yes. He snuck into our restricted area and took incriminating pictures of our compound that could tarnish our reputation as a world-class casino. Surely this kind of behaviour is not tolerated among your employees?" the wolf raised his eyebrow questioningly, "Perhaps you do not trust me to run this place with only the highest of standards?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"No, Mr Decro," the shark apologized, "His actions that night were not reflective of our intentions. Whatever he did was of his own device. We had nothing to do with it."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I see..." Decro trailed off contemplatively as he kept his eyes on the shark, who was visibly unnerved by his cold gaze.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Rest assured, this will not happen again. We have an explicit agreement with you and for that, we trust you completely.  There is no need for us to dig up anything from your establishment," the shark's eyes fell to the ground, "It would be a shame if you had ceased your...donations to the government over such a trivial matter."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A heavy silence hung between the both of them. Decro didn't seem to mind it, but the shark shifted uneasily in his seat. He bent forward and picked up his cup from the coffee table, giving it a sip to distract himself from the tension.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Okay," Decro finally answered, "I'm glad we have this understanding. The Silver Serpent will continue...funding your various ventures, and in return, the state will continue to assent to our slightly unconventional hiring practices."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The shark heaved a sigh of relief. "That would be good. The state is grateful for your steadfast support to its cause," he nodded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So about your...Mr Avon," Decro broke off his stare and gazed blankly around the room, "Would you like him back?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah, yes," the shark seemed to be hit with the sudden realization that the dragon was still in the custody of the Silver Serpent, "Avon."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'm afraid he's not quite in the same mental state as when we first discovered him," Decro continued nonchalantly, "But if you'd like him back we can extract him from the position we...'assigned' him to."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh, no, no," the shark shook his head, "We can let you keep him. Think of it as a token of appreciation for all the trouble we've put you through."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"That is very kind of you," the wolf turned back to give a nod towards the shark, "Rest assured he is put to very good use under our care."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"We should be the one thanking you," the shark bowed as he got up from the seat, "Once again, we appreciate your benevolence and generosity. We hope to continue working with you, Mr Decro."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Very well," Decro waved his hand. The shark took the cue and silently headed for the exit, leaving the lone wolf gently sipping his cup of tea.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was a good cup of tea.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ End ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
