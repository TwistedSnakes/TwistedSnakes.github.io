        The Silver Serpent Casino is one of the most highly-acclaimed casinos in the world, offering a wide variety of high-stake games that wins or loses people tens of thousands worth of credits in just a minute. If one were careful — or extremely wealthy — one would not find themselves in too much trouble apart from having a few thousand less in their bank accounts at the end of the day. However, with the Silver Serpent Hotel built right above the casino, some guests will inevitably be tempted by the allure of the thrill, the test of luck, and the illusory promise of the jackpot. This leads to the occasional guest who might play a game more than they should have, betting recklessly in the hopes that they can make it all back with a lucky hand.

        But the Silver Serpent Casino wasn't a regular casino: it was a bondage-themed casino. Service staff would be dressed in skintight latex suits and gas masks. Statues and other decorations would contain living furs within them, squirming against restraints underneath layers of rubber. Who would sign up for a position like this? Anyone with a sound mind and a sense of decency would not be willing to find themselves in the employment of such a questionable establishment. But a hanging debt reaching seven digits—maybe even eight or nine—would be enough to turn the unwilling into the willing. Until of course, they find out the full extent of what's in store for them, which by then would be too late.

        Flint the German Shepard was in big trouble. And by big trouble, we mean big trouble. Big as in an eight-digit debt that he owed to another gambler while betting a little too recklessly in the Silver Serpent. How he got into that situation was something he would rather not dwell on; what he was more concerned about was the situation he was currently in.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The person he owed the money to was Kyngios, a black wolf with gold markings. Kyngios had given him the option of paying back the full amount in a year or simply being his rubber pup for a month: anything beyond that would only happen if Flint was interested. Flint, however, seriously doubted that he would ever find this enjoyable. In fact, he was already doubting his decision as he knelt on the ground in Kyngios' hotel room, watching the wolf pull out a thick latex suit.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "I think would fit your body well, puppy," Kyngios mused out loud, "Tightly squeezing your muscles and giving them this nice shine."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Flint kept his mouth shut. He had already been punished once for speaking when he hadn't been spoken too, earning him a paddle across his rear. The pain wasn't unbearable but the humiliation of the situation stung hard. Was it too late to back out? But as he thought about it, he realized that there was no way to make a seven-digit sum a day in order to pay off the wolf. He gulped and steeled himself.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Put this on, pup," Kyngios ordered him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Y-yes, master," the German Shepard stuttered as he stood up and took the rubber suit. It was shiny and slippery in his hands, the result of zealous care for the rubber. Unfortunately, this was lost on Flint who had no interest in any form of BDSM whatsoever. Still, he had a debt to pay as he stripped out of his clothes.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "And unless you want some friction burns when you get out of the suit, I recommend you use this lube," the wolf tossed him a plain white pump bottle which Flint caught. He pressed on the bottle, giving it a few pumps to squirt the clear liquid into his palm which he began to smear all over his body. The liquid pressed his fur down against his skin, making his body smooth and shiny. Picking up the suit, Flint reluctantly slid his leg through the back opening of the suit.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Since you seem to be taking your own sweet time, I'm giving you a minute to get into the suit. The time started thirty seconds ago."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Flint's eyes widened and he quickly got himself into the suit, albeit with a little difficulty. The wolf was right: the suit really fit him well. Unfortunately, that meant he had to put in a lot of effort to squeeze the latex material over his body. Kyngios approached him and helped the German Shepard smooth the rubber, spreading the excess folds around the rest of his body before zipping the suit up at the back.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Flint was now fully encased in rubber below his neck; not even a hint of skin was showing.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Now kneel," the wolf commanded and Flint complied. Kyngios then took out a bunch of leather straps from his wardrobe. Metal buckles and rings hung from the straps, clinking together as the wolf dangled them.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Can't be a pup if you can still use your hands and legs like that," Kyngios smirked, "Put your hands on your back so that your wrists are as close to your shoulders as possible."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Flint quietly complied. Kyngios worked fast: within seconds the leather straps were around the rubber sub's arms, binding them together so that his elbows couldn't even move an inch. The incredible tightness made Flint wince in pain as he tried to endure it. Rubber sleeves went over his arms, giving padding for his elbows and making his entire arm look like a seamless limb. The sleeve reached his shoulders, pressing his palms against his back so that his fingers had no leeway to move.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Your legs are next. Bend forward so that your chest is on the ground." Flint didn't hesitate as he got into position. Almost immediately, his ankles were pulled against his buttcheeks, strapped in place, and encased in another layer of rubber. He had to stifle a whimper of pain as his knees were bent and secured with no freedom.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Now get up. Try walking around," Kyngios ordered. The German Shepard stumbled to his elbows and knees, taking awkward steps around the room. His rubber tail was raised stiffly behind him, sealed behind the thick layer of rubber that added a significant amount of resistance to his movements.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Good boy," the wolf grinned, "Now to make it official." He took out a black latex mask that was moulded in the shape of a canid head. Flint gulped. The mask would hide his identity, turning him into a generic puppy drone. Still, money was money. He would endure this for a month. After that, he would go free and swear to never, ever, come near anything remotely related to BDSM.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The mask had a long tube gag inside, which was inserted into his mouth. It reached over to the back of his head and went down his throat, making him almost choke. But the wolf worked fast, securing the mouth of the mask to his muzzle. The rest of the rubber was closed around his head and zipped down the back, compressing Flint's head from all directions. His vision was now through black-lensed eyes on the rubber mask, giving him a blank expression as he stood numbly in the middle of the room. A thick, leather collar around his neck and a padlock to the zippers sealed him into the suit.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Test your jaw."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Flint moved his mouth and the rubber jaw of the mask moved accordingly. Despite his mouth being kept open with the uncomfortable gag, his jaw movement would give the mouth of the mask a full range of motion as if his jaw wasn't restricted whatsoever.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Now, you have my permission to talk," Kyngios smirked, "Say 'master'."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Mrft wruff!" Flint made a weird bark-like noise as he tried to talk through the gag.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Good boy," Kyngios chuckled, rubbing Flint's head as if he really were a pet dog, "Now I want you to get on the bed so I can...have a little fun."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Flint grunted as he managed the jump with only his elbows and knees. The bed was soft and fluffy, although he could only feel it with his elbows through the thick layer of rubber. The wolf joined him, pulling the rubber puppy close so that he was spooning the pup. He stroked the latex material, going up and down the German Shepard's chest and abs.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Flint couldn't help but feel uncomfortably aroused as the wolf had his way with him. The hands went down to his crotch, where his emerging bulge was stuck beneath the rubber. That didn't stop the wolf from further teasing him, massaging his stiff member with fervent strokes.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "You like this?" Kyngios asked.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Flint wanted to say no; he didn't like this one bit. But his erection was giving him away. But who wouldn't be aroused from someone teasing their body like that?

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Wruff," he found himself saying yes before he could stop himself.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "And you're enjoying yourself here." That wasn't a question. It was a command. A command that Flint took to heart.

        Flint didn't think as he accepted every single suggestion that the wolf was making to him. In fact, he wasn't thinking at all: there wasn't much of the original Flint left in control as the wolf went on with the mental conditioning.

        Kyngios' dick was already completely erect from the anticipation of fully using the rubber pup, not just physically but also mentally. He shoved his member into the waiting maw of the puppy, thrusting as he felt the rubber walls of the pup's tube gag squeeze against the entire length of the shaft like a tight tailhole waiting to be used.

        And he was going to use it. He grabbed the pup's head and thrust his hips back and forth, making sure that every inch of his throbbing cock would be serviced by the pup's lubricating saliva and tight mouth-turned-fuckhole. Every plunge into the pup's pucker was a burst of pleasure, accompanied by a soft and contented moan.

        Warren, a blue German Shepard, had signed up to be a part of the Silver Serpent's thematic decor. Not the most glamorous job but it wasn't like he had a choice: he owed a debt to the Silver Serpent. Now, he was standing naked in a clean, white lab waiting for his new assignment. The room was empty, save for an uncomfortable metal frame that served as a short bench.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Just then, Seti, a white dragon, walked into the room, wheeling in a medical trolley loaded with bondage equipment. "Ah, our new subject," he grinned, "Please lie down on the chair so that your head and bum is on it. Warren silently complied, feeling a little awkward as he did so. The metal chair was just long enough for the back of his head to rest on it, ending at the base of his tail. The rest of his limbs sprawled awkwardly off the sides of the chair.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Now, hold still," Seti ordered. Warren complied as he found his upper arms strapped against the legs of the chair with leather straps that looped through the holes in the metal frame.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Ouch!" he yelped as his thighs were roughly pulled backwards at a right angle and strapped against the other two legs of the chair. His forearms and lower legs were strapped against the metal frame of the chair that ran along the ground so that his ankles and wrists were bound together, positioning him like some sort of rectangle.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Shh, furniture don't get to speak," Seti purred as he shoved a thick hollow gag into the canine's mouth.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Shh," Seti ordered again as he pulled the German Shepard's tail backwards along the bottom of the bench and secured it in place. Warren could only wriggle a little as he tested the restraints.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Seti tapped on a display that was built into the wall. Behind him, a wall panel opened and large, cuboid machine slid out of the recess. It was somewhat like an oversized oven with heating elements lining the inside, big enough to fit a person.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The dragon picked up a roll of rubbery tape from the trolley and began to wrap it around Warren's restrained body, strapping him to the metal frame.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Hnggg?" he struggled in panic but he soon found that impossible as his chest was fully secured in place. Two tubes went down his nostrils, stuck in place as the tape wrapped around his nose and muzzle. His eyes were next and his world went dark.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        When Seti came to his crotch, he began teasing Warren's sheath with firm pumps, encouraging the canine's member to come out to full length. Once his shaft was at full mast, the dragon encased the entire cock in a layer of rubber.

        Warren could feel himself being shifted and dragged along the ground, followed by the sound of a closing door. Then the air around him began heating up.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        The rubber tape around him began melting around him, using to his skin and the metal frame and forming a latex coating around him. When the rubber had melted halfway, the heat subsided, gently baking the liquid latex into a smooth material around the trapped canine.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The door was closed again and Seti tapped on the control panel. This one would give him a spray of soft resin so as to support Warren's body from people sitting on him, but soft enough for him to wriggle. Another tap started the sprays in the machine, coating the wriggling canine in a layer of black resin.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The resin mixed in with the half-hardening latex, forming a firm shell that stuck to Warren's skin, taking the shape of his muscular body. Then jets of cool air solidified the resin, making it permanent.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Seti pulled Warren's body out of the machine, making sure that the German Shepard could still breath through the breathing tubes. Satisfied, he picked a hollow plug and gently worked it into the struggling canine's pucker.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Inside his rubber encasement, Warren was feeling desperate. He didn't sign up for this, did he? Surely things like the anal plug that was filling him up wasn't a part of the repayment contract he had signed.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Unfortunately for him, it was.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Seti picked up the roll of rubber tape and proceeded to wrap the canine in yet another layer of latex. The breathing tubes were secured in place before being cut so that the breathing holes were just barely visible through the tape.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Then Warren was put back into the machine for another round of baking. With a smooth, resin shell to adhere to, the rubber sealed around him like a shiny, seamless latex cover. A vacuum-packing machine couldn't have done better as the latex contracted, pulling taut against the canine's form.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Once the process was completed, Seti pulled the newly-made chair out of the machine for the last time. The German Shepard's muscular body could be seen through the rubber. His sculpted chest and abs for the world to see. The canine's rubber dick was standing upright, ready to be used. His mouth was kept open by the hollow gag, inviting guests to use him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        And Seti would have the first try. He stepped onto the canine, seeing him struggle a little beneath the rubber. The latex shell didn't give the German Shepard much space to move so all the white dragon could see was an almost-unnoticeable movement despite Warren's attempts to escape.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        A long, draconic dildo shoved into Warren's tailhole, and another was placed into his maw, plugging it so that his mouth opening was sealed with an airtight seal. Then a piece of tape went over his nose, cutting off air from him. Seti then proceeded to step on him and mounted himself over the canine's upright shaft.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "You get to breathe once I cum," Seti commanded as he began to rise and fall against the canine's unobliging sceptre. He could feel the German Shepard struggling to rock his hips and thrust into his tailhole. The unwillingness of the situation made it all the more enjoyable for the dragon as he continued to take advantage of the canine's unfortunate position.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        After he climaxed he would let the German Shepard breathe. Then maybe he'd do a test run of the chair's other two holes before letting the casino guests take over. And he knew how the guests would love to break into a new chair like this.

        Sky was in a tight position. He was stuck against a sticky paper like a fly against flypaper; spreadeagle, naked, and very, very vulnerable. His dick had earlier been teased out and kept erect with a tight rubber ring. He had earlier been caught for marking a poker card: an accidental smear with a dirty thumb on the corner of the plastic apparently counted. And at the Silver Serpent, cheating was a serious offence.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Long story short, he was now going to have to atone. In front of him was a giant rolling machine that the conveyor belt below him was feeding him into. Its upper roller was rolling out a sheet of transparent plastic, ready to laminate whatever was being pressed below it.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Sure enough, when the roller reached his feet, it started compressing them down. The feeling was odd as if all his nerve endings were squashed together, making his feet immensely sensitive. A row of nozzles between the rollers began spraying a layer of glue over him as the plastic sheet was pressed over his feet.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Despite this flattening, however, Sky couldn't help but feel a sense of relaxation in his legs. There was no need to struggle; all he had to do was to give in to the compression as he was sealed into the plastic.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The roller continued up his knees to his hips, flattening his lower body to nothing more than a sheet no more than a millimetre thick. The pressure of the press was creating heat, giving him a comforting warmth. As the machine continued up his abs, his throbbing mast was pressed against his torso and pressed down. If not for the cock ring, he probably would've blown his spunk as the machine massaged his balls, squeezing them between the plastic laminate in its permanent prison.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Then his chest was next, pressing his fluff down in a neat pile as everything was flattened. Sky suddenly found himself unable to breathe but somehow he didn't need to. Everything was okay and he was strangely calm. Last came his head and arms. He looked above him, staring at the rollers as they pressed him flat, freezing his eyes into place. A thin spray of glue coated him just as the plastic sheet pressed against his face.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        Before he knew it, he was out of the machine in a solid piece. A second machine, this time a printer, descended over him as it printed markings all over his laminated body. With his eyes stuck looking forward, he couldn't see what was being printed, but it was the design of a Jack of Clubs card, turning him into a life-sized playing card.

        A rhino appeared from the side of his vision, preparing things on the side before coming over to cut the rectangular piece into proportions. After that, he was lifted up like a piece of light cardboard and transported.

        Before he knew it, Sky was mounted on a wall in the Silver Serpent Casino, watching people play games at various tables. But a crowd had started to gather around him, most of them eager to play with the newest addition to the Silver Serpent decor.

        A tigress bent down and started stroking his crotch, tracing the outline of his flattened balls with a teasing movement, neither too fast nor too slow. Unable to move, all Sky could do was to let out a soft moan. After all, with the entirety of his body fully relaxed, his senses could only focus on the sensations that people were giving him as they touched his laminated body.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "It sounds like he's enjoying it," he heard a guest say. Other people had joined the tigress, stroking his body up and down, feeling every inch of his sensitive regions. People were teasing the area around his crotch, pressing a vibrating massager to his inner thighs and circling the area. His abs were squeezed and pressed by eager palms and his armpits were lightly stroked as it crossed the line between erotic and ticklish.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The tigress had started to stroke his cock, pressing two fingers on either side of his flat member and pumping it with swift and firm movements. Sky could feel himself getting uncomfortably aroused. He didn't want to be caught climaxing in public, although none of this seems to be within his control anymore. All he could do was go along for the ride. And the ride was exhilarating. With each additional rub, he felt his arousal rise and rise. Just as he thought he couldn't be pushed any further, his new, sensitive body only surprised him with its heightened limits.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        And he was going to blow. He wanted to close his eyes but the laminate made it impossible. Instead, his vision blurred as all his focus went to the sensations in his throbbing, eager shaft. Just...

        That was when he realized he couldn't do it. The tight ring of rubber around the base of his member made it impossible for him to get the release he desperately wanted. That, however, didn't stop his guests from continuing to pleasure themselves by teasing his trapped body.

        Rombus now knew that he should not have taken the bet with the giant, feral dragon named Rei, but hindsight is always twenty-twenty. Their agreement was that the loser of the bet would be the other person's toy for as long as the winner wanted. And it seemed that the dragon had something in mind for him. Something that would last really, really long.

        To help prepare Rombus for what he had in mind, Rei got the Silver Serpent to prepare the sergal for his own pleasure. Javek, the head of the Silver Serpent's operations, saw to it personally that Rei's wishes would be fulfilled.

        Javek the tern led the sergal over to a lab in the back of the casino where a huge, black object sat in the middle. It had a wide circular base, followed by a short tapered neck which then widened to a huge body that was as wide as the sergal was tall. The body slowly tapered Rombus' height.

        "Come over here and strip naked," Javek interrupted his thoughts, guiding the green sergal over to a side of the object where there was a humanoid indentation in its surface. "I'm going to strap you into this thing so please cooperate with me."

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        Rombus nodded submissively and complied. The Silver Serpent had a reputation of resorting to extreme means to get what they want so he knew better than to refuse. The tern helped him step into the indentation, positioning him such that he was leaning against the tapering body of the object. His arms were spread open, curling backwards against the object's rounded body. His knees were bent backwards as if grasping the wide bottom of the object, just above the neck. His tail fitted nicely into the groove that went down between his legs. His member hung between his legs and Rombus blushed, feeling incredibly vulnerable in front of the tern.

        Javek busied himself strapping the sergal onto the object with rubber restraints, securing his wrists, arms, neck, chest, waist, legs, and ankles. Then a rubber bag was draped over the entire object and a motor was turned on.

        The vacuum began sucking the air out of the bag, turning the object into an oddly-shaped vacbed that clung to Rombus' skin, compressing his back against the object. Javek poked a hole in Rombus' mouth and attached a tube gag, allowing him to breathe as the vacuum bag was sealed shut.

        The sergal struggled against his rubber binds. This wasn't what he agreed to! But it was too late and there was no escape. The latex sealed him in place, refusing to let go despite his violent thrashes. Javek ignored the squirming sergal as he slowly rubbed the trapped victim's dick, arousing Rombus against his will. Once the sergal was fully erect, he adjusted the position of the shaft so that it was pressed against the sergal's abs, held in place by the taut rubber.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Javek watched the struggling figure in pleasure before tapping on a display panel beside him. Metal arms with steel nozzles descended from the ceiling, spraying black resin all over the gigantic butt plug that quickly hardened as it came into contact with the cool air.

        Beneath the rubber, Rombus was getting tired. The material around him was solidifying around him, keeping him trapped in his awkward position. Was he really being turned into a living butt plug?
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Sure enough, the freshly-made buttplug was wheeled outside to where Rei was seated in a giant field, waiting for his new toy. The dragon eagerly bounded over, looking the plug up and down. On one side of the plug, he could see the trapped form of the sergal just beneath the surface, frozen in a struggling pose as the resin hardened.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "If there's nothing more, I'll be going," Javek waved, "See you then." Rei nodded excitedly, wasting no time as he picked up the plug by its base and pressed it against his pucker.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Beneath the resin shell, Rombus could smell the dragon's strong musk as it flooded his nose. Despite his precarious situation, he couldn't help but feel intoxicated by the dragon's scent. Then he felt a wave of pressure over his body as he was inserted. The dragon's fluids entered the sergal's mouth gag, filling his maw with the dragon's flavour and forcing him to swallow if he wanted to breathe.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The dragon pulled the plug out of his tight tailhole before thrusting it back in again. "Hnngg," he moaned, "You feel so good within me." Rombus didn't agree.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Each thrust of the plug rubbed the dragon's muscular pucker against the underside of the sergal's dick and soon Rombus found himself panting from a mixture of arousal and the lack of oxygen as his mouth was once against filled with more juices.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">

        "F-fuck," Rei moaned, "Bet you regret losing to me now, huh?" Rombus only grunted in response, his voice drowned out by the dragon's loud gasps of pleasure. Suddenly, Rombus felt the dragon thrust his hips as if climaxing in a fervent burst, followed by the sounds of contented panting. Then he was put down on the ground.

        "You know what?" the dragon mused after a few minutes of recovering, picking the sergal-turned-butt-plug up again, "I think I'll leave you in for the rest of today."

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        There was the sound of soft groaning as the dragon pushed Rombus back up his tailhole. His pucker squeezed the neck of the plug, shoving the rounded tip of the plug against his sensitive prostate. The dragon gasped and shuddered in pleasure before laying down on the grass to take a good nap.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        Inside the plug, Rombus' throbbing cock pulsed against the tight and warm muscles of the dragon, breathing in the musky air of the dragon's insides. Guess it was too much to ask for the dragon to let him go after just one round of sex, but he certainly hoped he'd let him out soon.

        The black dragon only had himself to blame. While trying to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Silver Serpent guests, Negadrake crossed one boundary too many and was caught by Vuul, a black snake whose muscular form made the dragon feel like a twink compared to him.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Come with me," the serpent commanded in a deep voice. It wasn't a suggestion. It was a command. Negadrake grimaced sheepishly as he followed the snake, ashamed that he had been caught so easily.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The serpent led Negadrake up to the hotel corridors of the Silver Serpent before bringing him into the room.

        "I-I'm sorry, I didn't know that the back area was restricted," Negadrake stuttered before the serpent could say anything, repeating the story he had rehearsed in his mind on the journey to this room, "I'll delete these photographs and we can just pretend like nothing happened, alright?"

        This was an instruction. A command that he needed to obey. "I was here to investigate the people who had gone missing in the Silver Serpent," the black dragon bowed and admitted.

        "Maybe I can do something to make this right?" Negadrake replied hesitantly, "So we can forget about this whole incident and move on?"

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Very kind of you for you to offer but what is it you are suggesting?" the serpent encouraged. The smug look on his face revealed that he already knew what was going to happen; feigning ignorance only so that Negadrake would say it with his own mouth.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "I...I would like to offer my body to you," Negadrake replied before he could stop himself. Did he really want this? Probably so. The serpent's suit was form-fitting, snug enough to show off his muscular curves yet loose enough to leave the imagination yearning. And Negadrake wanted to know all of it.

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "I am!" the dragon protested. His heart was beating in his chest. He wanted this, no, he needed this. Something within him was burning and its flames could only be quenched by the serpent. "I would like to offer my body to you," he repeated with greater certainty this time.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        Negadrake didn't need to be told twice. He immediately tore off his clothes, flinging them in the corner of the hotel room. The serpent, too, was stripping at a leisurely speed, taking off his clothes with slow and intentional movements that sent the dragon mad in anticipation.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The shirt came off, revealing Vuul's muscular chest and arms as they captured the dragon's attention. His mind was whirring from all the possibilities. He wanted the snake pressed against his body. He wanted the snake holding him in a tight embrace. He wanted the snake thrusting every inch of his hard dick into his needy tailhole.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The serpent smirked smugly as if he could read the eager dragon's thoughts. As if he could see Negadrake's every lustful desire. If Negadrake didn't know any better, he could've sworn the serpent put those cravings there in the first place. But this thirst, this need, was something that came from deep within him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Once Vuul was fully nude, Negadrake stepped towards the serpent, basking in the glow of the snake's magnificent body. "Quench my thirst," he could hear himself saying his mind. The serpent wrapped his arms around the dragon's shoulder, turning him around so that his back was facing the snake. Then he felt the serpent shift, pushing the stiff end of his tapered sceptre against the dragon's quivering pucker.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The snake's member slid in gently, slippery as if already lubricated. Vuul's hands shifted down to Negadrake's waist, and with a swift movement he plunged deeply into the dragon and lifted him up so that the dragon's feet was no longer touching the ground. Vuul raised himself up with the strength of his muscular tail and the tip of it wrapped around Negadrake's waist.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Then he slowly pulled back his hips, sliding his dick out of the shivering pucker. Then he sunk his shaft back into the tight tailhole. Negadrake leaned backwards against the serpent's scaly chest, lost in the immense pleasure of the snake's girth within him.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The snake continued to thrust in and out, lifting and lowering the dragon over the entirety of his length as his deep moans filled the air. The dragon, too, was gasping in ecstasy as the snake ploughed his field.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The both of them continued enjoying each other's sensitive privates. Their scents gave away their state of arousal, filling the air with an intoxicating essence. Each thrust would fill Negadrake's insides, opening him up as the tip of the snake pressed against his sensitive prostate; and each time the snake pulled out he could feel the satisfying sense of friction that would be quickly replaced by a trembling need for the serpent's flesh once again.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Goo was also dripping from Vuul's body, coating the moaning dragon with a layer of black rubber. But the dragon wasn't alarmed; in fact, everything felt normal. No, in fact, it felt better than normal. It was pure delight. The satisfying latex of the snake hugging every inch of his body and engulfing his quivering form.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        They were both approaching their climaxes, closer and closer. Then both of them let out a loud gasp as they shot their loads. Negadrake blew his spunk over the carpet floor and Vuul filled the dragon's tailhole with a generous serving of seed.

        The serpent then collapsed on the bed along with the rubber-coated Negadrake. The latex around the dragon's body had formed around him like that of a faceless dragon drone, leaving no sign of the dragon that he had once been. The dragon panted on the bed, looking out at the room around him through the black lenses over his eyes.

        A bird walked into the Silver Serpent. He wasn't here as a guest but as an inspector from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA for short. On his head was an OSHA-approved white hard hat and on his feet were OSHA-approved safety boots. Even his pen and clipboard were OSHA-approved.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        All in all, he was here to make sure there was nothing in the Silver Serpent that would violate the thousands of safety guidelines that were laid out for public establishments. Sure, they didn't have to be OSHA-approved, but they had better be up to standards.

        To his immense dismay, however, the first object that greeted him was a chair in the form of a canine, bent over in an uncomfortable position. The person inside was squirming as another guest was forcing an oversized dildo into the canine's exposed tailhole in an attempt to stretch out the chair to new limits.

        Morsh stomped angrily over to the canine-turned-chair and glowered at the sight. The guest, noticing the bird's furious glare, immediately hilted the knotted toy into the squirming chair—eliciting a loud and helpless whine from it—before running away.

        "Who's in charge of this piece of...furniture?" he chirped angrily. A casino staff quickly ran over.

        "This...thing! This atrocity? What happened to safety? What if the nose holes get blocked? Can he breathe? And what if he needs to get out?"

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "I can assure you there's no need for him to get out, Mr..." the lizard pointed to the chair as he attempted to explain.

        "Mr Morsh to you, sir!" the bird chirped angrily, swatting away the lizard's hand with his wing, "Now bring me to your manager before I tear down the entire casino! After I've cordoned off this area and done a safety evacuation of this place, of course."
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        Morsh was led to the back of the Silver Serpent where the processing labs were located. However, instead of an office, the bird was led to a room that looked like a lab.

        "Where are w-mfft!" the avian was quickly silenced as a ball gag was shoved into his beak, keeping his mouth open. The gag was locked in place around the back of his head before he could struggle free. His wings clawed at his mouth but there was no taking off the gag.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Mfft hgnr wruthh!" he yelled, calling forth many legal terms and numerous lawsuits that he would like to rain down from OSHA upon the Silver Serpent.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Mhm, you were saying?" the lizard smirked, picking up four rings from a nearby table that had slid out of the wall. Morsh's eyes widened in fear: those were dimensional rings! Whatever was pushed through them would disappear and reappear on the other side of its corresponding portal ring. But what scared him the most was that those rings were definitely not OSHA-approved.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Prrftt rwhhgn hfft!" he cursed and swore as he flailed his arms but the lizard ignored his protests. His left foot was pushed through the opening of a ring and he watched as his leg disappeared. The ring was secured around the top of his thigh, leaving a smooth metal stump where his leg used to be.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Without two legs to keep him balanced, Morsh fell over. He flailed his missing leg, scratching what felt like the inside of a glass tube. Were they storing his leg away in some chamber? It had better been OSHA-approved.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        His other feet followed, leaving the legless bird rolling on the floor, furiously trying to fend off the lizard as he ranted about more safety regulations from behind his gag. His wings were next to go and the portal rings were secured around his shoulders. Morsh now consisted of a bird's head sitting atop a body with an avian tail, but no other limbs.

        "Orftt lwrar svrrth prfng!" the bird seemed to have an endless supply of steam as he continued his relentless but incomprehensible tirade. That would soon be put to an end as he was shoved into a limbless rubber suit and sealed into place. The latex was taut against his face and feathers, turning him into a squirming, giant pillow. Two holes were made in the latex above his nares, allowing him to breathe. However, his complaints were reduced to muffled rumblings that turned the newly-made latex pillow into a vibrating one.

        "Room service," a voice called from outside the room.

        An excited fox opened the door. "Hey, hey! Wassup?" he grinned. The sight of a room party could be seen behind him: a whole bunch of guests having a cuddle party on the giant bed that almost filled the entire room.

        "I believe you've ordered an extra pillow?" the hotel staff, a lizard, smiled back as he held out a wriggling latex pillow out.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Yes, yes! Thanks so much!" the fox jumped in glee as he grabbed the pillow and gave it a hug. The pillow began squirming and vibrating as Morsh growled angrily beneath his latex prison. The door closed and the fox's thrilled voice could be heard as he screamed, "Oh my goodness! This pillow vibrates!"

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        That night, Morsh would find himself in the midst of a very warm group hug, cuddled by numerous casino guests as they shared their body heat under the blankets of the spacious, fluffy bed.

        But Morsh wasn't pleased. After all, cuddle parties were strictly not OSHA-approved.

       Flint, after owing Kyngios a lot of money, is forced to be his pup for a month. Kyngios makes him suit up in latex and restrains him so that he's forced to walk on his knees and elbows. A rubber canine mask with dark lenses for eyes and a tube gag is forced over his head, and a collar is locked around his neck, securing the suit onto him. Kyngios then hypnotises Flint, turning him into an obedient pup before fucking his mouth and making him swallow his cum.
       <br/>
       Warren, to repay his debts, is bound to a metal bench. Latex tape is wrapped around his body before a huge machine melts the latex on. Resin hardens around him, and more layers of latex and resin are added over him. A hollow plug keeps his tailhole open, while his cock is left permanently erect. Seti then plugs his mouth and tailhole up with dildos, tape Warren's nose so that he can't breathe, and proceeds to fuck himself on the canine's cock. The dog-turned-bench is then put in the Silver Serpent lounge for guests to break into.
       <br/>
       Sky is kept in chastity with a tight cock ring, flattened, and laminated between two sheets of plastic. He's mounted on one of the casino's walls, allowing guests to tease him without ever letting him cum.
       <br/>
       Rombus is bound to a person-sized butt plug and a thick layer of resin is sprayed over him. A macro dragon, who Rombus lost a bet to, uses Rombus to fuck him in the ass, only to leave the butt plug lodged in his ass.
       <br/>
       Vuul hypnotises Negadrake, turning him into an obedient slave. Negadrake willingly fucks himself on Vuul, while Vuul coats him with goo, turning him into a faceless, latex, dragon drone.
       <br/>
       Morsh finds his limbs stashed away with portal rings, and his limbless body is put into a rubber suit and sealed. He is then used as a pillow.
