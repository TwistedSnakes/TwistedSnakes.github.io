                Gemoron was bored. Well, to be precise, he was frustrated. Well, to be more precise he was pent-up. Pent-up from not having “release” in a month. He threw his phone onto his bed. He should take his mind off “things”. He should go to the mall. Sighing, he got ready.

                He was browsing the clothes racks, not really pay attention to anything. “Shirt, shirt, pants, cap,” he mumbled. Suddenly, he saw another dragon browsing the racks across him. Like Gemoron, he was black. However, instead of his grey wings and leather chest plates, the other dragon had white wings and red chest plates. His horns were also white, unlike his black ones. He also stood a head taller than Gemoron. But that wasn’t what caught his eye. Instead, he was interested in the leather harness the other dragon was wearing. “That’s pretty brave,” he thought. He hid his face back in the clothes, pretending to browse. He could never bring himself to even talk about bondage, much less wear anything out. Perhaps someday he’d be able to do that, but for now, it’d have to remain a secret.

            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                He peeked up again, but the dragon was nowhere to be seen. “Aww,” he thought quietly, feeling a tinge of disappointment. “Nothing left to see here I guess,” he mused, turning around and bumping into someone. “Oh crap, sorr-,” he turned up to face the dragon he was watching.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “So, you were staring at me?” the other dragon asked.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Wh-what? No…” Gemoron stuttered, avoiding eye contact.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Oh don’t lie, I saw you checking me out,” the other dragon countered.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Sorry. I didn’t mean to. It’s just that I-”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Naw kid, just messing with you.” He rubbered Gemoron on his head, causing Gemoron to blush involuntarily. “So, you into bondage too?”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                He was taken aback by the other dragon’s directness. “No! I mean...well, you know, sorta…?”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Want to have lunch together?”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Uhh…” He hesitated. On one hand, he didn’t really have a lot of opportunities to explore the BDSM scene and meet people in it, and this would be fun. On the other hand, he would be meeting a stranger who was dressed up in bondage garb. What would people think of him if they saw them together?
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Well if you don’t like me just say so,” looking hurt, he walked off.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Hey! Wait. We can have lunch together,” Gemoron blurted out, almost on impulse, surprising even himself.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="segment-break"></div>
        <div class="segment">
            <div class="paragraph">
                “So, you want to go back to my place and play?” the other dragon, named Larvagandor invited.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Huh?” Gemoron was stunned, looking up from his steak.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “I said, do you want to come back to my place and play. I told you, I have a dungeon back at my place we can have fun at,” he winked at Gemoron.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Gemoron knew he shouldn’t be doing this, but it seemed fun. But he just met Larvagandor! Ugh. He should be declining… However, his pent-up bulge under his pants protested otherwise. “Yes,” he quickly accepted before he could change his mind.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Larvagandor’s tail worked its way under the table, nudging Gemoron’s sensitive bulge. “Yip!” he gasped from surprise. Quickly stopping himself, he looked around to see if anyone noticed. Gemoron grinned stupidly to himself throughout the rest of lunch, excited for what was to happen.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="segment-break"></div>
        <div class="segment">
            <div class="paragraph">
                Gemoron soon found himself in Larvagandor’s dungeon. “Whoa,” he admired, looking at rows of bondage gear. He had seen pictures of gear like this as he explored his bondage kinks online, but never in person.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                There was also a padded bondage rack in the middle, complete with full-body restraints and an overhead frame. Would he get to try that today? The feeling of anticipation grew within him.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Yo Gemo,” Larvagandor called out, holding up a rubber suit. “Go put this on.”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Gemoron excitedly grabbed the suit.
                 
                This would be the first time he’d get to try something like that. “Wait,” he looked around. “Where should I change?”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Just do it here?”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Wait what?” Gemoron blushed, gingerly taking off his clothes, revealing his cock escaping from his slit.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Looking good,” Larvagandor complimented, rubbing his emerging member, making Gemoron blush. He felt awkward but aroused, but he took it in stride. After all, there was only going to be more of that. He put on the rubber suit, stretching it over his feet, and up his waist. He paused to position his cock into the centre of the pouch, where a zip on the outside would give Larvagandor full access to his privates.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Larvagandor also took off his clothes, putting on nothing but a full body harness. He got out a set of rubber paws for Gemoron’s hind paws, rubber mittens for his arms, and a hood with open eyes and mouth. “Here, put these on too,” he handed Gemoron the additional gear.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Four metal cuffs came out next, and Larvagandor locked the paws and mittens in place. Larvagandor walked up behind Gemoron, hugging him from behind and rubbing his rubber-clad body. The feeling of the compressing rubber on his scales turned him on, and soon his dick was fully erect under the suit, pressing against the rubber forming a huge bulge. It didn’t escape Larvagandor’s notice, and smilingly he groped the rubber bulge, squeezing the member underneath. Gemoron gasped, involuntarily thrusting his hips into the massaging hands.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Get onto the bench.” Letting go of Gemoron, Larvagandor pointed to the bench in the middle. Gemoron eagerly got onto the bench, kneeling on the padded surface. “The other way round,” Larvagandor corrected him.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Whoops,” slightly embarrassed, Gemoron got off and on, the right way this time, resting his head on a metal collar that was open.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “So, you like butt plugs yeah?”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Yeah we were discussing this earlier over lunch, and I said I-”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Okay so we’re playing with butt plugs.” Larvagandor picked up the leather straps from the bench and began securing Gemoron limbs. Lifting up Gemoron’s wings and tail, he tied them up in ropes, before looping the ropes over the metal rings dangling from the overhead frame. He pulled the ropes tightly, pulling his wings and tail upwards and forcing Gemoron to arch his back.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The tight bonds began to turn him on. This wasn’t like the pictures of bondage he would see while surfing online; this was the real deal! He tugged against the restraints. Well, maybe a bit too tight for his liking. He tried to turn to face Larvagandor.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Hey Larva, could you-” he was cut off as Larvagandor’s grabbed his neck and forced him to look straight ahead. The metal collar closed, locking him in place. “Wait hang on a sec-” his mouth was gagged by a ball gag. “Mffrafi?” he asked.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “You remain quiet, or the gag stays on. Got it?”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Feeling a little nervous, Gemoron nodded his head.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Ok good,” Larvagandor removed the gag.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Gemoron struggled against the bonds, testing them out. He felt a little anxious about being trapped like that. “Ugh,” he thought, “I guess this is what bondage is about.”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                He heard a zip as Larvagandor pulled the crotch zipper down, exposing his tight, virgin tailhole. Gemoron looked downward in embarrassment and blushed. He instinctively tried to pull his tail down to hide his tailhole, but trying to pull his tail down only pulled his wing upwards. “Oww,” he gasped. *Slap!* Larvagandor spanked his ass. “Oh, right. Gotta keep quiet.”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Gemoron felt a cold liquid being pressed against his tailhole, smeared everywhere as the other dragon rubbed his paw up and down. Suddenly, there was a finger being nudged up his ass, going up his tailhole and poking around. He tightened his ass, but another finger entered, slowly widening him up.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Gemoron winced in pain. He wasn’t used to anyone playing with his virgin ass like that. Maybe he should come back another day. For now, he’d be happy getting out of this bondage. However, before he could ask to be let out, the fingers exited his tailhole, with a ribbed, rubber plug being inserted in its place, nudging his prostate. “Oh fuck!” he thought, almost gasping it out loud. “That felt good.”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The plug was slowly worked in and out. Slowly, Gemoron began thrusting his hips along with the plug, pushing against the plug and trying to work it in deeper. He was getting more and more horny with each passing second. “VRRRT” a vibrating wand turned on and was pressed against his hard bulge. “Ahh…” he moaned out loud in both surprise and pleasure, before quickly stopping himself. He needed to keep quiet.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Too late though, as Larvagandor walked to the front. With his neck locked down, he couldn’t see Larvagandor’s face, but he could tell he was indignant about his short outburst. Suddenly, the gag was forced back over his mouth. “Mffargh...” he whimpered.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Larvagandor went back and began working on the plug and vibrator again. Back and forth he rocked his hips, trying to get off. Suddenly the vibration and rocking stopped, and the plug was just left to sit in his tailhole. “What?” he thought. “Why stop?”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The front crotch of his suit was unzipped, releasing his member. Having been pent-up for so long, it twitched in arousal. The vibrator was turned on again and nudged gently against the tip of his dick. “Oh my goodness,” he thought. “More!” He tried to position his body lower so he could pleasure himself with the pulses of the wand, but his bound wings and tail held him high up. “Mrawhh,” he begged.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The vibrator was moved upwards, pressing against the base of his member, massaging it with its oscillations. “Mmmff,” he moaned in pleasure. He was going to cum, he could feel it.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Larvagandor smiled at the unsuspecting submissive. Picking up a cock ring, he slipped it over Gemoron’s eager member. “HFFMT?” Gemoron gasped in shock, quickly swinging his hips against the vibrator to try and get off. Larvagandor left the vibrator pressed against Gemoron’s crotch, watching the libido-fueled dragon’s attempts made futile with the rubber ring.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Actually, let’s keep that away,” Larvagandor tucked the rock-hard pecker down, zipped the rubber bulge back around it, and leaned the vibrator against the bulge. Meanwhile, Gemoron was feeling pent-up. After so long of self-imposed chastity, he really wanted to cum. Now, he was feeling a mixture of pleasure and frustration, trapped on a bench with nothing but a plug and vibrator for company.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Meanwhile, Larvagandor held a metal device in front of Gemoron’s face. “See this? This is a ‘Pear of Anguish’. It goes up your ass, I turn the screw, and…” Larvagandor demonstrated the device, showing how the leaves of the plug opened outwards. “Spreads your ass,” he finished, grinning.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Gemoron’s eyes widened. He definitely did not want that up his sensitive tailhole. He yelped his disapproval, struggling against the restraints. However, Larvagandor ignored his protests and proceeded to slowly prod the device against Gemoron’s tailhole.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Gemoron clenched his sphincter, but the rounded metal pear, with help from the copious amounts of lubricant, slid in anyway. Gemoron grunted from behind the gag, the plug filling and stretching his ass out despite not being opened yet.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Larvagandor shifted the plug in his ass, before slowly unscrewing the pear. Gemoron winced in a mixture of pain and arousal as the plug spread his tailhole open. He struggled against the bonds, but the restraints were unyielding to his attempts at escape. Instead, all he could do was whimper into the gag.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Larvagandor tugged at the pear, and it pulled against Gemoron’s insides as it shifted. “Looks like we can do better,” he slapped Gemoron’s ass and resumed widening the pear. The cold metal pressed against his rectum, and he yelped in pain. Just as he felt he couldn’t take anymore, Larvagandor slapped his ass. “I think we’re good for today, don’t we?”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Gemoron sighed in relief. Any more and his insides probably would had burst. He tensed his ass muscles a little, feeling the metal. It had pressed against his insides, sitting comfortably. He squeezed again, feeling his anus shift around it. The metal petal nudged against his prostate, and he involuntarily blushed again.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “VRRRT” sounded the vibrator as it was turned on and thrust against his zipped-up bulge. He could feel Larvagandor securing the vibrator in place. “MFFTTTT!” he humped, rubbing the smooth rubber against the leather bench. “Let me cum please!” he begged in his mind.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Ahhh!” Larvagandor yawned as he stretched his arms and wings. “I think I’m done for today actually,” he teased Gemoron, slapping him on his frustrated cock. Gemoron flinched from the impact. “What? Done for today? He hasn’t gotten to cum yet!” he thought, struggling against his restraints.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Larvagandor turned off the vibrator, and walked over to Gemoron’s neck restraint, getting ready to unlock it. Gemoron shook his head quickly. “Oh, you want to play more?” The hooded dragon nods. “Okay, sure, we can play longer.”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The vibrator was turned back on, stimulating his dick. He just needed that cockring off, and he could cum! His eyes were suddenly met with a black rectangle of rubber, as Larvagandor secured the blindfold over his eyes. “Mfft? GRWARR!” he fought back.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                “Hmm, still being noisy?” A rubber muzzle found its way onto Gemoron’s face, closing his maw around the ball gag, unable to open. “Mmmmmm!” a whimper came out, much softer this time. “Please… let me cum?” he begged, hoping Larvagandor would release his dick now. The cockring gripped the base of his member securely, ignoring his pleas. “I haven’t had release for a month now…”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-break"></div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Larvagandor however, had other ideas. “Well, I’ll check on you tomorrow, alright?” He flicked the light switch, plunging the room into darkness. “Good night boy,” he wished the squirming dragon, as he closed the door on him.
