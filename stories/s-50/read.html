The eagle a few seats in front of Duga got up and went to the teacher's desk. "You got a B+, not bad Carter," the teacher announced.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Thank you, sir," Carter nodded, taking his report before going back to his seat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Kiera." The shark beside Rottie walked to the front to receive her grades. "An A. You're doing amazing."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Thank you, sir," she nodded, taking her report back.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Duga."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The arcanine gulped as he got up. The walk to the teacher's desk felt like a mile as he trudged his way to the front to stand in front of the black wolf, Mr Roland.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Duga," he repeated again, a little sterner this time as his eyes scanned the report. The arcanine silently shifted from one foot to the other. "D. Abysmal," the teacher looked Duga straight in the eye with a stern look, "Are you even trying at this point?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Some students giggled. The arcane hung his head in shame, avoiding the glare of Mr Roland. "See me after class for remedial," the teacher snarled. Nodding in embarrassment, the arcanine hung his head as he walked back to his seat, sitting in silence for the rest of the class.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mr Roland?" Duga powered into the empty art workshop which doubled as the wolf's office. He shifted about nervously, wishing to be anywhere else but here. Friday evenings were usually when students went home to savour the start of the weekends and he didn't want to be spending that time receiving remedial lessons.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah, you're here," Roland's voice came from behind a paint-splattered curtain, followed by the black wolf himself, "Are you ready for your remedial?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Duga nodded. "What do you need me to do today?" he asked nervously.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"We're going to start with the basics today: form and sketching. See the plinth over there?" Roland pointed to a circular, silver disk that stood in the middle of various spotlights pointing at it from all directions. "Take off your shoes, stand there, and pose."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The arcanine complied, stepping up to the metal disk and standing awkwardly on it. "Like this?" he asked uncertainly. The disk was almost as wide as he was tall, making him feel fairly small on it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hmm," the wolf walked around him, looking him up and down. "Let me get you into a more dynamic pose. It's all about the form of a subject," Roland explained as he shifted the arcanine so that he was standing on one side of the plinth. He adjusted Duga's stance, giving him a confident and triumphant pose with his feet were spaced shoulder-width apart and his chest puffed out to enhance the look of his pecs beneath his uniform. His arms were crossed in front of him and his chin was raised so that he still looking forward but with a self-assured expression.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oww!" the arcanine yelped as something sharp poked his neck, "What was that?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Sorry, must've been my sharp claws," Roland waved it off nonchalantly, "As I was saying, once you have the subject's form, you need to capture it. Stand still for the next part."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The arcanine complied, letting his eyes wander about the room. The art workshop was quite large and spacious, and shoulder-high dividers separated it into four quadrants. One of them was meant for the more traditional forms of art: drawing, sketching, painting, and the likes. Easels circled a sculpture in the centre of the area, the result of the last class of the day. Another quadrant was set up for pottery, filled with clay-caked pottery wheels and a firing kiln in the corner. The third was set up like a photography studio, and the fourth—the sector that they were in—was the crafts workshop filled with woodworking and sculpting tools.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Duga let his eyes wander around the room as he waited for Roland's next instruction. His body felt numbly stiff as he tried to hold his position without moving. The numbness spread down the back of his neck down his spine and soon his limbs felt frozen.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Hmm. If they were sketching, why weren't they in the drawing quadrant of the art workshop? His eyes flicked over to the wolf who was sitting watchfully on a chair with his sketchbook and pencil beside him, untouched.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Uh, Mr Roland? Why are we-" his words were cut off as the wolf stepped up to him and clamped his mouth shut with a strong grip.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mghht?" Duga gasped in surprise.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Shh. I told you not to move, didn't I?" Roland hissed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mmm..." the arcanine mumbled nervously. The numbness in his neck was slowly spreading upwards. The sudden realization hit him: he couldn't move his fingers, toes, or any other part of his body for that matter. His eyes widened in shock and he tried to squirm but Roland's grip was not letting go.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft!" he whined loudly. He needed to tell the wolf that something was wrong! He needed to get help!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">But...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wait. The prick at the back of his neck. </span><span class="italic">Roland did this to him!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The realization, however, was useless now as the paralysis spread up to his face, locking his alarmed expression in place. His body was now held in position and his face was frozen, allowing only his frantic eyes dart around the room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>After making sure that the arcanine was fully paralyzed, Roland slowly released his grip, letting the living statue stand on its own. It was quite a sight to behold: a majestic canine in all its glory, standing confidently in its boastful pose.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Duga, however, felt nothing like that. His eyes darted around nervously, trying to communicate with Roland with soft, faint growls from the back of his throat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Don't try to call for help," the wolf smirked, "Nobody comes down here after school anyway. Nobody will hear you."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The arcanine let out a helpless whimper. </span><span class="italic">What was Roland going to do to him?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Standing behind the frozen arcanine, the wolf stepped up to the plinth. Duga could feel Roland press his chest against his back, wrapping his arms around the arcanine's figure and exploring them with his hands. His uniform offered no protection as the wolf began to squeeze his pecs, feeling his muscular build that he had acquired after years of religious gymming. Then the ridges of his abs were traced with firm and intentional motions, circling around his sturdy flesh as if massaging him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Duga let out a whimpering gasp, feeling incredibly vulnerable as he was forced to stand still. His paralysis was his prison, keeping him defenceless against the wolf's advances. Behind him, he could feel Roland's bulge press against his firm buttcheeks. And then he started humping. The wolf's member bumped against his thigh, knocking the Duga's solid body off balance.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The arcanine's heart skipped a beat as the ground sped towards him. Thankfully, Roland caught him before his face could smash into the ground.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Naughty boy," the wolf teased, giving Duga's crotch a tight squeeze as he set the arcanine back up, "Trying to run away from me?" The arcanine couldn't respond as he was set back in place. The wolf went over to a shelf and picked up a tin of industrial glue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"No more running away, boy," he instructed as he pried the cover off with his sharp claws, revealing a clear, sticky liquid. Using a paintbrush, he scooped up a generous amount with its bristles and smeared them over Duga's foot. The arcanine felt the sticky liquid soak his fur, glueing him in place on the plinth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"This will make sure you don't run away," Roland sneered, "Not until I've done what I need to do." Putting the brush down, he stepped back up to the arcanine's body and resumed his caressing. His hands slid under Duga's uniform and combed his fur with his fingers. The frozen arcanine's eyes glazed over as the wolf's strokes made him feel relaxed and comfortable. But he had to focus! He needed to escape.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf continued to have his way with him, coming over to the front until their bulges were grinding against each other. Roland put one hand behind Duga's head, grabbing a fistful of the arcanine's fur and tugging it hard as he brought his face close.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You're mine now, boy," he smirked, "A living statue that belongs to me. And I'll make you the work of art that you're meant to be."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Duga's eyes fixed on Roland's and he let out a nervous yelp. He didn't understand what the wolf wanted to do to him but he didn't like the sound of it. Roland continued to stare at the arcanine with a hungry look in his eyes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Let's show a bit more fur, shall we?" he asked nobody in particular, seeing that the only other person in the workshop had the answering capabilities of a block of concrete. Roland picked up a pair of shiny scissors and within seconds, the arcanine's uniform laid around his feet in strips of soft fabric. Only the student's black, tight trunks were left to hide his dignity.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And thus, we reveal the model's form," he grinned, certainly enjoying himself. His hands rubbed against the arcanine's soft fur, taking in the bulk of his pecs, abs, and back with his sense of sight and touch. "A tasty boy," he muttered into the frozen arcanine's ear, "Perfect to keep. Forever."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ngnn..." Duga protested quietly with his unmoving maw. </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Roland gave his living statue a pat on the bulge, rubbing his palm over the generous bulge in circular motions. Despite being paralyzed, the arcanine could feel everything that was happening to his sensitive part. The wolf felt around until he found Duga's ample balls, pushing them back and forth teasingly between his fingers.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Hearing his student's soft and helpless whimpers, he grinned and gave the arcanine's crotch a rough pat, eliciting a yelp of pain. The front of the Duga's trunks was damp with his involuntary precum.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Grngg!" Duga struggled to communicate his displeasure. He felt deeply embarrassed as he was fondled against his will by the black wolf. The wolf, however, was going to show him no mercy. The scissors were brought back to cut away the arcanine's trunks, rendering him fully nude. If not for the paralyzing agent in his bloodstream, Duga's cock would have been standing at full mast for everyone to see. Instead, the agent immobilized his muscles, keeping his rod throbbing painfully in his sheath.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The arcanine's exposed balls were then fondled and felt up as the wolf admired the arcanine's well-endowed jewels. Roland pressed his thumb and index finger against one of Duga's testes, squeezing them until they popped to the side.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mrr!" the arcanine yelped painfully but that only encouraged the wolf to repeat his actions, slowly working the arcanine over with an increasingly-intense ball torture. Duga's eyes darted around the room frantically, hoping for any sign of escape but to no avail.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With his free hand, Roland grasped the arcanine's sheathed member tightly, pressing it upwards so that Duga's balls were exposed. With a swift movement, he brought his other hand against the arcanine's nuts. There was a loud smacking sound as his palm impacted the firm flesh. Duga whimpered in pain, trying to endure the pain. But the wolf only repeated his actions, making the arcanine's balls more and more sore with each passing slap.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The repeated torture left the arcanine gurgling in his throat and incomprehensibly begging for it to stop. Only then did Roland let go of the arcanine's privates and stand up.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Still with me, boy?" he grinned, stroking his hand through the top of the arcanine's fluffy hair.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Nhng..." the paralyzed student responded weakly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Good. I need you to focus on the next part of the lesson," Roland grinned and stepped off Duga's plinth, moving towards a table where an odd, metal device sat. He picked it up and turned it around in his hands. "A good artist should know all his tools," he explained, bringing the device towards Duga.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Unable to turn his head, the arcanine looked out of the corner of his eyes to look at the device. It laid in three parts: two dome-shaped shells and a hollow, metal rod.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">What was it for?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"This might be new to you." the wolf smirked, giving the underside of Duga's balls a gentle pat with his free hand, "But don't worry, I'll give you a live demonstration."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A drop of lubricant was squeezed from a bottle, coating the rod with a copious amount of a transparent goop. The wolf then crouched down in front of Duga, face-to-face with the arcanine's sheath. With his fingers, he squeezed the tip of the arcanine's sheath and pressed it back, revealing the pink, fleshy tip of the arcanine's dick. At its tip was a bead of shiny precum from Duga's earlier painful arousal.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Excited to find out what this does, aren't you boy?" Roland taunted. Duga shuddered internally. He had a feeling he knew where the rod was going to go but he was hoping against hope that he was wrong.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Unfortunately for him, his suspicions were right. The metal rod acted as a sounding device as it was pushed against the opening of his urethra. There was a sharp pain as he felt it slide down the inside of his shaft, spreading his quivering cock wide and filling him up.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The rod went deeper and deeper within him until it reached his bladder. His bladder sphincters were squeezing against the tip of the rod, preventing it from going in any further. But the wolf only pushed harder, forcing the arcanine's muscles open to accommodate the new girth that was now inside him. The arcanine's frantic yelped filled the room as the rod was lodged painfully within his urethra. </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Next, we have the first shell," Roland picked up the smaller metal dome and brought it in front of Duga's face, turning it around so that the arcanine could take a good look of it. Sharp spikes covered both its inside and outside surfaces, threatening to inflict pain to any form of flesh that was pressed against the dome.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Roland focused his attention back onto the arcanine's sheath. He pressed his fingers against the opening of the arcanine's furry sheath, spreading them apart and getting Duga's cock ready for the next part. The spiked dome was slowly and carefully pushed into the opening until the inside of the dome was fully sitting on the top of arcanine's throbbing cock. Then the sheath was closed back over the dome, keeping it trapped inside. The spikes were poking against Duga's flesh and skin threateningly as if daring him to make one wrong move. Not that the arcanine could do anything: his body was still not his to control.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The other dome, spiked only on the inside, was then put over the entirety of his sheath. A metal clamp at the bottom of the outer dome was closed around the arcanine's balls, painfully pulling them away from his crotch. The rod and domes were screwed together into a solid piece, forming a rigid chastity device.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hnnnrr..." the arcanine cried helplessly. The device on his crotch wasn't hurting much yet but the fear of what it could do to him was frightening. "Yhhr!" he suddenly yelped loudly as Roland grabbed and pulled on the device, roughly tugging it back and forth, forcing the spikes into his flesh. His balls were slightly swollen from the tension caused by the device's clamp, making him look even more endowed than before.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hmm..." Roland ignored the arcanine's shouts of pain as he stepped back and admired his statue, "It's missing a little something." He dug through some drawers and pulled out a hollow dildo. He applied glue on the inside of the dildo and pressed it tightly against the tip of the chastity device. The arcanine tried to endure the agony as the spikes were roughly pressed against his cock again but once the wolf was done, a rubber cock stood proudly in place of where his should have been.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Like the new look?" the wolf taunted. The idea of arcanine's cock being replaced with a mere toy was amusing to him. He grabbed the rubber shaft in his hands, gently stroking and teasing it before finally squeezing its firm tip. All that the arcanine could feel was the moving spikes in his chastity device. It was a devious device indeed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ngnn...no more," Duga groaned softly. The strength was slowly coming back to his throat, allowing him to weakly make out some words.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Roland stepped back to examine the statue. The paralyzing agent was wearing off and he could see the arcanine slowly gain control of his limbs. He would have to work fast. Putting on a pair of thick, rubber gloves, he went to the back of the workshop and pushed a trolley over to Duga's plinth. On the trolley was a small vat of thick, clear liquid sitting over a heating element. Picking up a large paintbrush, he scooped up a glob of warm liquid and spread it over the arcanine's face.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The clear liquid dripped down the arcanine's face, coating his fur with a thick layer of fluid. The air cooled the liquid down and it began to harden over his face. The arcanine's eyes widened as he realized what the liquid was: industrial resin that they had used in a previous workshop class.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span class="italic">The wolf was encasing him in solid resin!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ngnn!" He tried to fight the numbness in his body. He could feel his arm moving but it was as if he was dragging it through thick butter rather than through thin air. He needed to move faster if he wanted to escape.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Roland, however, effortlessly carried on with his mission to coat the arcanine. The resin was generously brushed over Duga's chest and arms and as they cooled, it made moving harder and harder for the trapped arcanine. Duga was struggling as hard as he could but all his efforts were reduced to mere tremors beneath the resin. More of the resin was crudely painted over his back and legs, threatening to cool him down and trap him on his plinth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"P-please," Duga found his voice as he started to plead, "Don't do this to me." The black wolf was brushing another layer of resin over his body, making the arcanine's encasement feel more and more permanent with each passing movement. Despite the solid resin trapping his body in an unyielding prison, his resin-mixed fur seemed to retain its fluffy texture. Roland continued to paint around the arcanine's crotch, making the rubber cock point forward in excitement.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'll study harder, I promise," the arcanine whimpered, "Please don't turn me into a statue."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And waste all my efforts in preparing you?" Roland sneered, "I think not. Just shut up and be a good display piece." He grabbed a blob of resin and pushed it into the arcanine's mouth, forming a makeshift gag as it cooled and stuck to his teeth, leaving his maw open. The arcanine was once again reduced to a whimpering mess.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The black wolf took out two clear, circular lenses, wiping them down with a clean cloth until they were free of smudges. Holding one between his thumb and index finger, he slid it under Duga's left eyelid and repeated the same with the right. The lenses felt constricting against his eyes as he looked desperately around him but there was no way to remove them with his body frozen like that. The wolf, however, brushed more resin over his eyes, permanently sealing his eyelids over the lenses as they cooled.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Let's try a different pose for you," Roland said as he put down the paintbrush and picked up a device that looked like an industrial hairdryer. He turned it on, blowing a blast of hot air through its nozzle which the wolf directed at the arcanine's shoulders and knees. The heat slightly melted the resin, making it soft enough to allow Duga to move. But before the arcanine could shift, Roland grabbed Duga's shoulders and bent the arcanine over so that he was on all fours as if he were a feral beast. More resin was brushed on his hands securing him in place on the plinth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Stuck on the disk, Duga tried to thrash about but the black wolf held the struggling arcanine in place until the resin was cool again. "There's no escape for you," Roland taunted Duga, watching the arcanine's eyes dart nervously towards him. He felt the arcanine's movements slow down until the statue was once again immobile before resumed brushing more resin over Duga's joints, locking his pose in.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Once satisfied that the resin had settled, he stepped back and admired the arcanine statue. The arcanine was posed on all fours as if he was a feral beast with his mouth stuck open in a half-roar.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah, if only you could see how good you look," Roland said wistfully, "You should be pleased that I'm turning you into a work of art. You'll have much more potential this way than as a failing student."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Duga certainly did not think so but his muffled protests fell on deaf ears. The bright sunlight that had earlier streamed through the window was now gone, replaced the purple glow of dusk. The wolf seemed to have noticed this as he took off his gloves and stretched his back. "That took longer than expected. I was so caught up in my art that I didn't notice the passage of time," he spoke to himself before turning to the arcanine statue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Still," he continued, "You'll make such a lovely centrepiece for the school, don't you think?" He bent down and gave Duga rubber cock a few hard pumps, teasing the caged arcanine and enjoying the student's helpless whines. Once he had his fun, he got up and wiped his hands on a damp towel before heading towards the door.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Good night, statue," he called mockingly as he turned off the workshop lights and locked the door behind him, leaving Duga alone in the dark, unable to move. Standing still without a single hint of movement, just like a good statue should.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Duga woke up to the feeling of someone patting his head. It was morning now and the black wolf was stroking his hard, resin-coated fur. The arcanine let out a low and pleading growl from the back of his throat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So," Roland ignored the statue, "Artistic inspiration struck last night. Having you out on display would look amazing, but we can do better. With your form, your figure, and your rubber cock..." He gave the phoney phallus a stroke before continuing, "You're the embodiment of sexual fantasies. And hence my idea: you'll be an interactive exhibit for just that."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The arcanine didn't understand what Roland was going on about but he didn't like the sound of it. Nonetheless, though, he figured he would find out one way or another. His fate was entirely in the hands of the sadistic wolf.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He could hear Roland behind him, rummaging through more boxes of tools. The hairdryer-like device from before was turned on and brought to his face, blasting him with a gale of hot air. The resin in his mouth started to melt, turning into a thick, sticky liquid.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mwar...huhng ghuh!" Duga moved his mouth and tried to speak through the gunk but the wolf grabbed his maw with one hand, holding it open. A thick, canid dildo was thrust into his mouth as Roland began throat-fucking him with it. The heater was turned off but the forced fellatio continued.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dildo-thrusting was displacing the resin, forcing the sticky liquid down his throat and coating his gullet with a thick and heavy layer of the fluid. He could feel his resin-coated tongue and teeth rub against the dildo's shaft as it was pumped in and out of his mouth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gwarr!" he whined loudly. It was a Saturday. That meant that there wouldn't be other students or teachers around to come to his rescue. The two of them were well and truly alone, and Duga's pleas were useless as the wolf continued to eagerly orally fuck him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The resin was cooling in his mouth and throat, forming a hard tube that led from his maw to his gullet. His breaths were laboured as panted from his mouth between the plunges of the rubber cock. Some of the resin that had gone down his throat pooled in his stomach, filling his stomach with an uneasy sense of its weight.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Without warning, Roland shoved the dildo deep down Duga's maw, lodging its sizable knot in his mouth. The tight hole formed by the resin kept the cock in place with no way for the arcanine to dislodge it. The long shaft of the dildo extended down his throat, giving him an uncomfortable bulge in his neck as it filled him out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Duga desperately wanted to struggle. To fight back. To escape. But with his body encased in a solid, resin shell, there was no avoiding the inevitable. His mouth was now an open hole ready for people to fuck and there was nothing he could do to stop them.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A tube was inserted into the base of the dildo and with a connected syringe, the wolf began to pump a stream of resin through the tube. The resin leaked out through the tip of the dildo where it flowed down his throat, coating every inch of his insides with more resin. The remaining resin trickled down to his stomach, threatening to clog his digestive system.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His imprisonment was feeling more and more permanent by now. Even if someone found him like this, would he be able to escape? And could they get all this resin out of the system?  He could only move his eyes as he tried once more to plead with the wolf to end this madness. He didn't want to be a statue!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Roland, however, wasn't about to stop there. Duga felt another stream of warm air against his rump, melting the resin. Then his supple cheeks were spread apart, exposing his tailhole.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft!" he groaned through the makeshift cock gag. His tight pucker was quivering and he was nervous for what was about to come next. Then the tapered tip of a lubricated dildo was nudged against his tense tailhole.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gnggrr!" the arcanine let out a pitiful whimper as he felt the rubber shaft push roughly into him. The sticky resin acted as a crude lubricant to help spread his hole open as the black wolf repeated the same process with his tailhole. Roland shoved the dildo halfway into Duga's rump before noticing the arcanine subtle shivers of pain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Haven't taken anything up your virgin ass, have you boy?" Roland taunted as he slid the dildo out, resting its tip on the entrance of the arcanine's pucker, "Nothing to exercise your tight little hole." He squeezed a generous helping of resin along the length of the rubber phallus before thrusting it back in.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>In and out the dildo went, going slightly deeper with each subsequent thrust. Duga's tailhole felt like it was on fire from the anal abuse he was getting. The friction felt like it was tearing at his insides, assuaged only by the balm of the resin. However, even the resin was not on his side as it cooled and left his pucker open and vulnerable.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yip!" Duga yelped as the rubber dick bore into him and nudged against his sensitive prostate. His trapped cock instinctively extended, pressing its fleshy tip against the spikes of his chastity. The piercing sensation shot through his body as he struggled to endure the agony. It was as if the pain of his predicament was eating away at his sanity, asking him to let go and give in. Each moment of consciousness only brought forth more pain and his body was fighting to knock him out. Still, he had to hold on, if only for the slim chance that he could somehow escape this mess.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf continued working the dildo in earnest, covering the walls of Duga's tailhole with a coat of resin that slowly extended deeper and deeper into the arcanine's body. Roland could almost thrust the entire length of the rubber shaft down the fleshy tunnel. The cock pushed his insides about, giving him a sizable bulge in the stomach as he was pounded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>After a lot of hard work, Roland managed to get the entire shaft of the rubber cock up into Duga's rump. He could tell from the desperate, high-pitched cries of the arcanine that he was almost at his limit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Almost.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a malicious sneer, he pushed the base of the canid dildo, forcing its hefty knot against the arcanine's tight muscles. There was a sharp yelp as Duga instinctively clenched his muscles in, fighting back as he tried to expel the dildo. He was already feeling incredibly swollen inside and the prospect of being knotted was not at all desirable.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But his efforts only made Roland push harder. With a squelching pop, the knot slipped past Duga's entrance. The arcanine's clenched muscles closed around the knot, hilting the dildo deeper into his body and closing tightly around the narrow neck between the knot and the base of the dildo.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Looks like your ass is hungry for that knot," Roland smirked as he taunted the defenceless arcanine. He grabbed the base of the dildo and tugged it back and forth, pressing its shaft against his tight walls. The arcanine only clenched tighter, trying not to stimulate his already-aroused tailhole and cock.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A similar tube on his mouth gag was connected to his anal intruder, allowing Roland to pump his insides with even more resin. Another tube was squeezed into the slit of Duga's faux cock and in the same way, resin was forcefully pumped down the hollow sounding rod and straight into his bladder. The arcanine's insides were covered from inside and out with the resin, ready to cure and perfectly preserve him as a statue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"We're almost there, boy," the wolf stroked his head. "Soon you'll be ready for the big reveal," he informed the frozen arcanine with a smirk on his mouth, "But first we need to cure the resin and make your form truly permanent."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He watched the arcanine's deep, red eyes day around the room frantically before looking back at him. Duga's expression was hard and stoic beneath the resin but he could only imagine how desperate the arcanine must be feeling within his clear prison. A prison that would soon to be permanent.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He removed the tubes and stepped back to admire his handiwork: a lifelike feral arcanine statue that he had completed in the span of mere hours. A sense of accomplishment washed over him as he set up plexiglass panels around Duga's plinth, boxing the statue up in a clear chamber, sealing the edges together with duct tape. A pump was attached to a port in the side of the box and turned on, blowing grey fumes into the makeshift gas chamber.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The fumes filled the arcanine's lungs, making him want to choke if not for the resin around him. In fact, the resin seemed to feel harder against his skin and fur. It shrank a little as it cured, tightly squeezing Duga's body and giving him a feeling of constricting discomfort.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Still, all he could do was to sit still and do nothing. Do nothing as the gas cured the resin. Do nothing as he was turned into a statue. Do nothing as his fate was permanently sealed, just as his body was.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Soon, Duga the arcanine would be nothing more than an object.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>After what felt like hours, Duga the object was finally free of his gas chamber. The phallic gag in his mouth was easily removed but the dildo in his ass gave the wolf a hard time as he tried to get it out. He shifted it back and forth as he slowly worked the huge knot out. It came out with a pop and he slid the dildo out, admiring the hole that was left behind. The arcanine's tailhole was left wide open as if inviting him to abuse the smooth, resin hole. Duga's mouth was left in a similar state, giving the arcanine the appearance of being hungry for cocks to fill his maw. That could not have been further from the truth, for the only thing that the arcanine wanted now was freedom.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Not that he'd get it because he soon found himself installed in the middle of the sports wing of the school. In the large room, Duga could see trophies and medals lining the glass displays that covered the white walls, reflecting the victories of the sportspeople and athletes of the school, some of them even having went on to pursue a successful career in sports.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The silence was broken as he heard Roland's voice coming from behind him. "And here he is, boys," the wolf declared, "My newest creation." There was the sound of various footsteps as he watched people gather around him, dressed in muddy rugby gear. He looked up, recognizing the school's rugby team looking down on him, murmuring to each other excitedly. The captain of the team stepped in front of Duga and grabbed the bottom of his chin.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Look who we've got here," the dragon grinned, "Guess you've been selected for an 'early graduation' eh?" he taunted. Hozyr. Duga had crossed paths with Hozyr a few weeks ago when the dragon had wrongfully accused the arcanine of stealing from him and was subsequently embarrassed. It was ironic that Duga was now at the dragon's mercy. Roland was standing beside the dragon and Duga looked helplessly at him for an explanation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, these boys have been training hard all morning. On a Saturday, no less," the wolf elaborated, "Quite unlike you, standing there and doing nothing all day. So what better way to reward our school's dedicated sportsmen than to let them have a go at the new art piece for the school?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The captain stepped onto the plinth until his crotch was pressed firmly in front of Duga's muzzle. He tugged the top of his compression pants, pulling it down and revealing his armoured jockstrap. He rubbed his sweaty bulge against Duga's muzzle, filling the arcanine's nose with the musky scent that was the result of hours of running about in the field. He could also smell the dragon's arousal as he began to hump his armoured crotch against the arcanine's face.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The reptile's dick was soon erect beneath his jockstrap and he pulled it down, revealing the entire length of his ribbed cock. It stood proudly in front of the dragon, leaking a bead of pre at its tip.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ready to take one for the team?" he taunted as he plunged his girthy dick down the tight, smooth chute that was Duga's throat. He let out a roar as he let loose, allowing his arousal to take over his body as he pounded the arcanine's maw with no restraint.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mrrngg!" came Duga's muffled protests, ignored by his captive audience as the rugby team watched their captain take the lead. Roland stood by the side, watching the scene with a sick sense of satisfaction. The arcanine's nose was subjected to the full strength of the musky dragon's cock and arousal as his mouth was treated as if it were nothing more than a hole to fuck.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Come on, team," the dragon waved to the rest of the players. "Don't just stand there, get into formation. Chris, go out on an all-out offensive attack from the rear," he instructed with a smirk, amused by his cheesy joke.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Sure thing, captain," a coyote stepped forward and revealed his cock, already erect in anticipation of what was to come. He plunged his rigid rod down the arcanine's vulnerable tailhole, ploughing it for all it's worth as he had his way with Duga.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Inside his chastity device, the arcanine's member was getting aroused against his will. He tried his best to suppress it but his libido wasn't on his side. His cock tried to escape his sheath, only to once again be restrained by the spiky prison that was sealed in place by the unyielding resin. Unable to go anywhere, it throbbed painfully in its constricting confinement, inflicting the arcanine with bursts of pain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His two assailants continued to forcefully fuck him from both ends, making full use of his tight openings for their lustful pleasure. Duga could not have felt any more miserable than he was. He was being sexually abused with no way to respond or show signs of pain. All he was left with was his helpless eyes and muffled pleas and even that was being ignored in favour of everyone else's sexual pleasures. His own cock was trapped in an escapable prison that rewarded his arousal with more pain and a rubber dildo was a mockery of his phallic entrapment.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>In fact, one of the team members had noticed his imitation cock and had started playing with it. The arcanine's precum leaked through the urethral rod, trickling out the tip of his rubber dick.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hey, look!" the player pointed excitedly at his crotch, "His fake cock's leaking out pre!" Some of the others gathered around and watched as he took the rubber dildo in his mouth, giving it a pleasurable treatment that only inflicted more pain on the arcanine as the cage was shifted within his sheath.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Duga's two penetrators' thrusts got faster and faster, each of them making their way to the inevitable peak of their arousal. With a roar of ecstasy, the team captain shot his copious load down Duga's throat. The coyote followed right after, knotting the arcanine's tailhole and filling it with his warm seed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>To the statue's horror, there was no way for him to expel the cum in his maw the warm fluid began to flow down the back of his throat, forcing him to swallow it all. The dragon pulled out his sizable shaft and let it hang down between his legs as he looked at Duga. The arcanine looked back at him with his pleading eyes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Like the taste of that?" the dragon sneered, "That'll be all you'll get to eat for the rest of your life. The breakfast of champions." The other players guffawed around him as another one stepped beside the captain, ready for his turn at the arcanine's maw. The captain stepped back to let the next player have a go.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You done back there, Chris?" he nodded at the coyote.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Uhh, don't mind me. A little stuck here," came the sheepish response. The coyote had knotted himself in Duga's tight tailhole and was trying to pull it out but to no avail. Duga could feel his ass filled with the canine's seed, trapped inside by the swollen knot. The player that was devouring his cock had started to grasp the arcanine's testicles and started rubbing them with firm and teasing motions.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragon rolled his eyes. "Fine, let the rest use him once you're out. This statue will need all the sustenance he can get." He waved his hand as he turned to leave the hall.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh, and Mr Roland?" he turned to the watching wolf.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yes, Hozyr?" the teacher came up to him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Knew I could count on you to settle a score with Duga," he nodded smugly at the arcanine statue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"It's nothing," Roland grinned back sheepishly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'll get my father to send some 'donations' towards your art studio," the dragon offered.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Thank you, thank you," the wolf bowed after Hozyr as he walked away, leaving the Duga behind to be abused by the rest of the team.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And the arcanine statue would be abused for a long time indeed.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ End ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
