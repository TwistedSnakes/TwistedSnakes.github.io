So, very, very dark.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf was in a cylindrical glass tube, not that he'd know what it was. He had been artificially created, or "germinate" as it was called. For the past two decades, the glass tube that had contained him had been his home. His reality.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His first moment of consciousness was of him floating in a body of liquid with cables stuck to his skin, monitoring his vitals. The liquid sustained his body with oxygen and nutrients, constantly filtered and renewed to facilitate his growth. Suspended in the middle of the glass tube with his eyes closed, he helplessly pawed at the nothingness of the fluids around him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Years ticked by. Stray mental objects evolved into thoughts. His body grew and one day he could feel his paws brush against the hard, curved surface of his universe. Yet his eyes still perceived nothing in the darkness.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Beyond his sense of touch, his entire reality existed solely in his mind. Visions of flashing colours, erratic pangs of emotions, and incoherent thoughts were the results of a world devoid of stimuli to help guide his mental growth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>All he could do was float in the darkness and wait.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And wait.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And wait.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf woke up with a start to a barrage of new sensations that assaulted his senses. The tube lifted up around him, dropping him roughly to the ground.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For the first time in his life, his ears felt the piercing pain of sound in his ears.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For the first time in his life, he understood what the sensation of coldness was.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For the first time in his life, the closing of his eyes made a difference.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For the first time in his life.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was truly awake.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf scrambled about frantically on the floor, trying to come to terms with his new reality. His glass tube had been transported to this empty cell before unceremoniously releasing him in a deluge of water. His rite of birth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The cell took the form of a small, perfect, white cube devoid of windows. Apart from a door seamlessly built into its wall and the empty glass tube, it was totally bare. But the concept of cell meant nothing to him: the only thing that he was struggling to come to terms with was that this was his new reality. His shivering body found a corner of the cell where, driven by instinct, he huddled against the wall, hugging his knees close to his chest. His wet fur dripped amniotic fluids onto the smooth ground, forming a pool around him. He shivered.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His first breaths in this world were shallow and fearful. Fear. Another new experience. He would later experience this fear again as more people entered his cell to remove the glass tube before leaving him alone again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He would also experience more emotions over time. Emotions embedded in instincts through generations of evolution.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>All of them.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>All of them except for happiness.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf slowly learnt what it meant to be alive. To stay alive.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Hunger needed to be met with food. Food in the form of a nutrient paste mechanically extruded onto the floor for him to eat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Fear needed to be met with shelter. Shelter in the form of a particular corner of the cell that he had grown accustomed to hiding in.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Brightness needed to be met with darkness. Darkness in the form of closing his eyes, wishing that he was back in the glass chamber and away from this place.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>These were things one typically learns from birth but when it came to the wolf, he might as well have just been born. He learnt to interact with the world around him. Stimuli from the outside. He takes action. Then more stimuli in response. Natural instinct was his teacher, imparting to him the skills he needed to survive.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But natural instinct taught him one more thing: the desire to escape.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Escape? What did such a concept entail? It required one to be able to perceive a place for which to escape to. A place which the wolf could not comprehend in his limited experience.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But it was still there. A desire, a hunger, a craving for freedom.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Freedom.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Unknown to the wolf, he was XN-1847-8272-1843: an identification number to distinguish objects. Identity was something that the wolf could not comprehend. In his mind, he wasn't "him". He just was.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But his identity as an object meant that he had a purpose. A purpose that someone out there had assigned to him. A purpose that would require him to be processed in order to fulfil. Which was why one ordinary day, the door to his cell opened and two technicians strode in, each one picking him by his upper arms and dragging him out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He knew not how to fight back. Instinct had not yet taught him the meaning of danger. Instead, fear flooded his thoughts once again as he was dragged into a new and alien world of white corridors, the walls of his reality once again broken as he was thrown into a bigger world.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was brought to a room with a metal frame mounted on rails. Welded into it were metal cuffs which the wolf was methodologically secured in. They snapped in place, restraining him securely with his limbs splayed outwards in the shape of an "X". More clamps were closed around him, automatically locking themselves around his neck, elbow, and knees. A steel cage-like frame encased his torso, ending at rings around his shoulder and pelvic joints at his limbs.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A soft sound came out from the wolf's throat, half growl, half whimper: another product of his survival instinct, useless against his unyielding surroundings. The light was bright in his eyes, forcing him to squint and struggle helplessly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For the first time in his life, his mind—conveyed in a language only his mind could comprehend—conceived of a question: What were they doing to him? With his head securely restrained, his search for answers manifested in his frantically-darting eyes and his pleading yelps. His actions would prove to be in vain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a jerk, the frame he was bound in started moving along the rails which led through a tall rectangular opening in the wall into pitch-black darkness. But unlike the first darkness, this one was not a comforting one. The brightness of the previous room was a splotch of light, disappearing as his body was dragged around a bend.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sounds. There were sounds. His inexperience was too great to even grant him recognition of the whir and clangs of the machinery, all of them cloaked in the darkness. Only coloured spots of indicator lights could be seen, darting back and forth in the darkness like robotic fireflies.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf's heart was beating loudly in his chest. A physiological response to an emotional state. Fear. But that feeling was mixed with a second emotion: curiosity. He was curious about the moving lights in the darkness and his eyes followed their rigid choreography and angular turns in the midst of the void.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Then two beams of green light shone over his spreadeagle body: one in front and one behind, scanning his body. Reading his contours and measuring his dimensions. His form reduced to mere numbers just as his identity had been.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Without warning, his body was assaulted with the sprays from dozens of unseen nozzles around him. The stinging liquid clung to his fur, getting into his eyes and mouth. The wolf hastily closed them, trying to squeeze them out of his eyes as the taste of the caustic acid filled his mouth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Brushes reached out for him, scrubbing his fur and scouring his skin. The cleaning agent that had been sprayed onto him served to chemically burn the dirt and perspiration off his hide, all while creating a burning sensation on his skin.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mahhh! Mahhh! Mahhhhhhh!" he let out a series of whimpered cries, sustaining each one until his lungs ran out of air before he took another breath and repeated desperately.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The brushes fell away and a spray of cool solvent washed his fur. The solvent flushed away the stinging agent, leaving behind pink and sore skin beneath his white fur. Blasts of wind from unseen fans then dried him up, leaving the strong smell of antiseptic in the air.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Metal arms grabbed his shoulders, wrists, thighs, and ankles in their vice-like grips. The restraints on his body frame released him and the mechanical grips forced his limbs to bend. His wrists were firmly pressed down to the back of his shoulders and the front of his feet were forced upwards to touch his rump. Steel rings were applied and welded in place, keeping his limbs permanently bent.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf sobbed loudly, afflicted by the pain of the restraints and the overwhelming fear. "Mahhh!" came his tortured screams, again and again. A blinking light slid mechanically in front of the wolf's face as if staring him in the eyes. Scared and crying, the wolf looked back at it hopefully. Was it here to help? Suddenly, the unseen arm advanced upon the wolf's face. Clamps closed around his maw, holding his muzzle in place with its painful grip. With a slow whirring of gears, it began prying his jaw open.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf tried to close his jaw but the cold steel was heartless and unyielding. Still, it didn't stop the wolf from trying. His maw was shivering as he strained his muscles, tears forming in his eyes. The clamp opened his mouth wider and wider beyond the point of comfort and into an agonizing angle until it finally stopped.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Heeze!" the wolf wheezed helplessly. His tail was writhing around as his body struggled to escape. There was a sharp pain in his nose as two robotic, semicircular tubes forced themselves into his nostrils and into his nasal cavity.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mah-!" he tried to call for help but a hollow tube was forced into his open maw, curving down to the back of his throat. A metal frame was shoved into his mouth, circling the tube as it held his jaws open. A claw grabbed his writhing tongue, painfully stretching it out to the front of his lower jaw and keeping it from moving.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mhhh!" he screamed with a muffled voice. For the discomfort to stop. But the machine had no compassion for his shivering form as the tubes in his nose thrust further into his body, snaking down his throat until it reached the entrance of his windpipe and gullet. They forced past his epiglottis, past his vocal cords, and into his windpipe, causing the wolf to resist even harder than before.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The two tubes connected back to each other, forming a solid tube that went down his mouth and into his windpipe. Its tip began expanding until it filled the entire span of his trachea, securely lodging itself there.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A full, sleek, metal helmet was put over his head, securing the mouth gag and nose tubes in place. An electrical probe pierced the back of his neck and into his spinal cord, forming a mental link into the helmet. Arc welders sealed the metal together, making sure that nobody could take off the helmet. It would connect to his mind as well as feed visual input through displays in front of his eyes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A cylindrical, metal device was brought up to the wolf's crotch. The open end of the cylinder was put over his sheath and there was a hiss as it formed an airtight seal over it. It began vibrating in pulses, stroking his sensitive part.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Arousal. His first arousal would be artificially induced in the midst of his brutal bodily mutilation.  His whimpering gasps were an emotional mix of pain, fear, and unwilling arousal as his shaft slowly emerged from his sheath. The vibrating inner walls of the cylinder were lined with firm padding, coaxing his pink flesh out until it was at full length, filling out the entire metal tube. A ring at the base of his shaft tightened, keeping his shaft permanently erect in the tube. A metal enclosure was clamped over his testicles, keeping them separated and constantly compressed as the device was welded to his cock tube.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf's survival instincts were to thrash around. To fight back. To escape. But millennia of evolution had not prepared Mother Nature to face the onslaught of mechanical processing he was being subjected to. Instead, his instincts settled for inaudible cries that were drowned out by the sound of the machinery around him. Cries that were evolutionarily honed to call the attention of one's mother, one's caretaker. But objects were not granted this privilege. Objects had no rights to luxury. Objects had nothing.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Another device was pressed against his pucker, lubricated with industrial oil. Its base looked like an open port that led up to its mechanical body, covered with metal connector nodes and ending at a tapered tip. It pushed against his tailhole and the wolf instinctively clenched his muscles. That only made the pain worse as in one sharp movement, the device was forcefully thrust past his muscles and into him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The girthy shaft of the makeshift dildo pressed against his prostate, making him blush from the wave of sexual kindling. The tip of the device reached deep within him, filling out his insides near the entrance of his large intestines. The base of the device around his pucker expanded, clamping around the edges of his sphincter and keeping it permanently open and the device lodged firmly in his tight tailhole. The base of the device opened up to an internal tube, forming an entrance into the wolf's insides. A large tube was connected to the opening and a smaller one connected to the tip of his encased cock. The tubes were pulled to the back, neatly hung on the frame he was restrained in.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf was barely hanging on to his sanity as the modifications were made to him one after the other, with each additional modification turning his organic form into one consisting of cold, unyielding steel. </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The brace around his body suddenly opened up, leaving him to hang by his neck until a metal structure was immediately secured to his body. This one was fitted to his body, the precise result of his body measurements from earlier. It consisted of an inner frame that hugged the shape of his chest and abs tightly, leading around to the back where a central column ran down his spine. A neck brace kept him from turning as it connected to his steel hood. The outer frame was the shape of a cuboid, just big enough to contain the width and height of the body, made compact with its bent limbs.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Electric welders danced around him, welding everything in place and making his imprisonment permanent. The cables from his encased dick and anal port were attached to a circular port at the back of the cuboid's outer frame, joined by the cerebral links as well as the nasal and oral tubes. His tail was bound to his back by leather straps, keeping it completely immobile against his spine.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The metal frame was rotated so that he was facing up again and he was lowered into a padded box which closed around him. The wolf was left suspended in the air by the metal frame that locked his body in an immovable prison. The box was moved into a storage room and an opening in its back allowed cables and tubes to connect to the circular port behind the wolf's metal frame.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The life support system in his body was turned on and he suddenly found himself being fed a nutrient solution that flowed through the tubes and down his throat. A stream of air went down his nose tubes and straight into his lungs, dictating the speed of his breaths. The cock tube and anal device began vibrating, keeping his sexual organs constantly stimulated.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The object would later be used for his preordained purpose but in the meantime, he would be useful. The tube in his tailhole would flush away his organic waste from time to time and the cock tube would drain away his copious precum and released seed which would later be recycled for amino acid and protein synthesis.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And the whole time, the object would be kept in the dark.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Always in the dark.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf woke up from his feverish slumber. He noticed that the stimulation had stopped, giving him sexual relief for the first time in a very long time. He had been in this state for months until the pain became a part of his daily life so this respite came as something new.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But something felt different. It was as if his thoughts were shoved into a compartment of his mind, making space for something else in his brain. Despite the removal of his sight he tried to open his eyes again. Unlike the previous times, this time his vision was flooded with a plethora of information. Numbers and images filled his mind.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He examined the images one at a time. They depicted a world that he had not seen before. A world somewhere out there. He watched them with a sense of wonder and curiosity. The images were moving. More specifically, the people in the images were moving. There were three thousand, seven hundred and fifty-five people in the building.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>People. Numbers. Building. These were new concepts to him but yet somehow he understood them completely. Unbeknownst to him, he was installed into a skyscraper as its security mainframe. With it came a knowledge module that was installed into his mental link. His mind was connected to the computers in a server room, allowing him to access to all the relevant information required to carry out his tasks.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The system was feeding him information. The building had one hundred and seventy storeys, one hundred and fifty of them above the ground and twenty below. Above the ground, most of the floors consisted of office floors and meeting rooms. The floors underground housed the operational aspects of the building: racks of computational servers, air-conditioning units, backup power generators, and so on.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Serving these floors were forty-six elevators arranged in an intricate network around the building to spread out the congestion. Security posts were located around the building's many entrances and on various floors throughout the building. Robotic drones guarded the entrances and patrolled the corridors.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And he was in charge of this entire system.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He watched moving images, slowly understanding what they were: live feed from the thousands of security cameras throughout the building. He was to look out for signs of threats: dangerous individuals, unidentifiable objects, building fires, and so on. And should anything happen, he could lock down the various doors and shutters to isolate the threat or utilize the robotic drones to neutralize said threat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He watched through a camera feed as a sleek, metallic black robot walked down the corridor in the midst of people in business suits, streaming from both directions.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>What if he...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As the thought materialized in his head, he suddenly found himself looking through the eyes of the robot. He was standing still in the middle of the corridor with people bumping against him as they strode swiftly by, so busy that they had no time to apologize. What good was apologizing to a robot, anyway?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Ignoring the annoyed glances of people for his obstruction of the path, he looked down at his body. It was made out of sleek and streamlined curves, forming a genderless frame of reinforced steel. He brought his hand to his face, twisting his wrists and bending his fingers. He was in a body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His heartbeat sped up in his organic chest. A long-forgotten instinct was coming back to him: the hunger for freedom. But along with it came with a new feeling: hope. Guided by the floor plans installed in his mind, he turned around made for the elevator.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A small jolt of electricity surged through his body and the robot halted in its tracks. Pain. The system was punishing him with pain for needlessly deviating from the patrol. The wolf winced and turned around. Its patrol would lead down another corridor, taking a weaving path through more corridors before looping back to this spot. Going down rows of office cubicles, he continued down the assigned route and a slow vibrating started in his crotch, stimulating him. Sexual stimulation was to be his reward.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf felt shame. Shame for being a slave to his sexual stimulation. Shame for his helplessness to escape. Shame for his entire existence. He guided the robot, winding through the corridors as he watched out for signs of suspicious activity. Nothing.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His journey led him past another set of elevators. He needed to do this. A pair of lift doors opened and people started stepping out of it. Without waiting for them to get off, he pushed past them and stood in the elevator to the disdain of the other passengers. The electrical shocks got stronger, making him convulse in his metal frame. The robot he was controlling was shuddering too, twitching in time with his physical body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The elevator went up first, dropping off groups of passengers until it reached the top floor. Once it was empty, the wolf overrode the elevator system, making it descend past the other floors as it headed for the ground floor. With a gentle ping, its doors slid open and the trembling robot stumbled out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Trying to endure the agony, he quickly made for the exit. People turned their heads to look at the runaway robot as it ran down a corridor, past the main lobby, and out the double glass doors. The pain seemed to disappear as he was greeted by a dazzling orb of brightness that hung in a void of warm orange and pale blue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was watching the sunrise.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His heart was beating in his chest and throbbing in his head. This was his escape. He ignored the pain as he made his way down the concrete pavement in jittery movements. The pain be damned, he was going to be free.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The numbers in his head told him that he was soon to be out of the building's compound. Just a bit more pain. Just a few more steps...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The robot crumpled to the ground as the system ousted it from the security network. The wolf was back in his dark world, watching the moving images in front of him. In one of them, a black robot was lying on the pavement in front of the building with its limbs splayed out haphazardly on the concrete. It laid there for a few minutes before it slowly came to life, getting up and returning to the building.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf mentally whimpered.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was trapped here.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Until his physical body was extracted from the building, he was trapped here.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A black robot walked down the corridor of one of the basement floors. Unlike the well-furnished office corridors above ground, the basement levels felt sterile with their smooth, white walls and floor. The robot turned around a corner and carried down another long corridor, slightly trembling as it went down a route that it was not meant to be on.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>This floor housed the security system. Robots came here to charge when their power ran low. But instead of heading to the room with charging ports, it opened the door marked "Security Mainframe".</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The room was filled with rows and rows of server racks. This was where the camera feeds were processed and where the robots were being controlled. Cables from the top of the racks were bundled together, leading towards the centre of the room. The robot followed them, getting closer and closer to the middle of the huge room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And the robot came to the central point of the room. In its middle was a cuboidal metal frame mounted on a pedestal, securing the spreadeagle body of a white wolf in its middle. Cables and tubes ran out the back of the frame, connecting to the various wires in the room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>This was his body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But there was no time to fret. The robot had with it a wireless link device meant to turn a physical cable connection into a wireless one. The wolf sent instructions to the drone to unplug his body from the mainframe before linking them back through the wireless device.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The world went black as the drone disconnected him from the system. His breathing was suddenly unassisted by the air pumps and he found himself having to use his diaphragm to keep himself alive. He had been hooked up to the system for three years now, getting increasingly reliant on the life support that the building provided him with.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>To his relief, the feed of thousands of cameras returned to his vision. He was connected back to the system, albeit with a bit of lag as the signals had to travel through waves in the air before it reached his mind.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There were no cameras in the security mainframe room but the wolf knew the robot's ID. He connected to the robot, once again able to see his body. A black transceiver module was mounted on the back of his frame and a similar one was hooked up to the cables. His breathing still had to be done manually but it was a small price to pay for freedom.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Looking through the eyes of his robot, he took the body down and shoved it in a huge, canvas bag that the robot had brought along. The wolf could feel the air go stale and suffocating around him as its opening was zipped shut. Then he picked himself up, carrying the cuboid-shaped bag close to his chest as he made for the door.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The robot ran up the stairs, skipping two steps at a time as it ascended to the first floor. Trying to blend in with the crowd, it slowed down to a walking pace as it made its way through the crowd. The robot would shut down once it left the boundary of the building but he would cross the bridge when he came to it: he needed to get to freedom first.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Then there was the sound of shouting. Someone was pointing at him. The security modules didn't teach him language but he knew enough to tell that he was in trouble. He threw caution to the winds, pushing past people as he ran for the exit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was out through the double doors and bolting down the pavement. He just needed to get to the boundary. His pursuers were hot on his heels but he was faster. Just a bit more...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The outside world disappeared as the security system kicked the robot from the network again and his bagged body was thrown down the pavement and out the gates of the compound. His vision was once again filled with rows of security feed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But he was out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was free.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His heart was beating in excitement. His head was throbbing from the adrenaline. He was free.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But he was also trapped. Unable to do anything. He listened to the sound of his laboured breathing. What now?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Suddenly, he could feel his body being moved. The sounds indicated that the bag was being unzipped but he could not see a thing. He switched his feed over to the security camera pointed at him, only to see people in uniform standing around his metal frame.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He had been caught.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>They examined the metal transceiver on his back. Then a look of recognition flashed across their faces as they figured out what it was doing. Through his ears, he could hear their voices around him, speaking in words that he could not understand. One of the men bent down and disconnected it from his system and everything went black.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf continued listening to his breaths. What was going to happen to him? To answer his question, a gaseous anaesthetic was fed into his nasal tubes and put the wolf to sleep.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf was woken up by an intense feeling of pain and pleasure that consumed his entire being. Electrical pulses were surging through his body, making it hard to think or even control his body's convulsing. But at the same time, his privates were still being stimulated at the devices' maximum intensity. The conflicting sensations assaulted his senses relentlessly, making it unbearable for him. He was gasping in pain, producing his inaudible cries for mercy.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was a click sound and the feed of thousands of cameras flooded his vision again. Despite the cruel punishment, he was still required to perform his security duties. And no matter what he did, the torture would not stop. It was to be his eternal torment for attempting to escape.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Saying that the wolf was in pain would be an understatement. It was pure suffering for him, both physically and mentally. He had came so close to escaping, only to have it taken away. Should he have made sure that he had a proper escape plan beyond the compound limits? Sure, but he didn't know any better.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And now all he had left to look forward to was a lifetime of physical anguish.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>No.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He could not stand for that. He needed to escape again. He controlled the robot closest to the server mainframe and made his way to the room, violently shuddering the entire way. He threw open the door to the security room and ran down to where his body should be.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But instead of his body, he saw a block of solid metal. Its dimensions were the same as that of the cuboid frame that had contained his body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>No...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He stumbled to the back of the solid block and sure enough, wires and cables ran out the back of the metal cuboid. As if to add salt to the wound, his white, bushy tail was visible through an opening near the base of the block. It was pointed upwards and compressed against the metal surface by a glass plate that was adhered in place. What was left of his organic being was reduced to a mocking display.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The robot crumpled to the ground, convulsing as he mourned his fate. Evolution had blessed, no, cursed him with emotions. He was feeling agony. But along with that came one last, new emotion: grief.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was in grief.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf was not aware of how long his robotic form had been there when he regained lucidity. He stumbled to his feet, still convulsing as he made his way over to the server racks. Driven entirely by his grief, he punched through the glass windows, damaging the computing units inside. His vision flickered as backup units were activated to replace the broken ones.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But the wolf didn't stop. The robot went over to another row of units and destroyed them too. His vision was slowly getting fuzzy. There was a spark. And the spark went on to create an electrical fire. Still, he continued his rampage, destroying everything in sight.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was harder and harder to control the robot as the security mainframe was damaged beyond repair. The fire was starting to consume the entire room, filling it with smoke. The robot stumbled over to the centre of the room, next to the metal block.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With one last effort, it tore the cables off and disconnected him from the security mainframe. The live feed was cut off and his breathing had to be manually controlled now. But each breath he took was filled with smoke and carbon monoxide. It was suffocating.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And it was dark.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He coughed and choked on the suffocating air as his head swam around. It felt like his senses were fading away. The pain. The pleasure. Slowly dimming into the blackness.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His world, his reality was getting darker and darker around him as he faded out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was dark. So, very, very dark.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ End ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
