So, very, very dark.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf was in a cylindrical glass tube, not that she'd know what it was. She had been artificially created, or "germinate" as it was called. For the past two decades, the glass tube that had contained her had been her home. Her reality.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Her first moment of consciousness was of her floating in a body of liquid with cables stuck to her skin, monitoring her vitals. The liquid sustained her body with oxygen and nutrients, constantly filtered and renewed to facilitate her growth. Suspended in the middle of the glass tube with her eyes closed, she helplessly pawed at the nothingness of the fluids around her.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Years ticked by. Stray mental objects evolved into thoughts. Her body grew and one day she could feel her paws brush against the hard, curved surface of her universe. Yet her eyes still perceived nothing in the darkness.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Beyond her sense of touch, her entire reality existed solely in her mind. Visions of flashing colours, erratic pangs of emotions, and incoherent thoughts were the results of a world devoid of stimuli to help guide her mental growth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>All she could do was float in the darkness and wait.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And wait.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And wait.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf woke up with a start to a barrage of new sensations that assaulted her senses. The tube lifted up around her, dropping her roughly to the ground.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For the first time in her life, her ears felt the piercing pain of sound in her ears.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For the first time in her life, she understood what the sensation of coldness was.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For the first time in her life, the closing of her eyes made a difference.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For the first time in her life.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She was truly awake.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf scrambled about frantically on the floor, trying to come to terms with her new reality. Her glass tube had been transported to this empty cell before unceremoniously releasing her in a deluge of water. Her rite of birth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The cell took the form of a small, perfect, white cube devoid of windows. Apart from a door seamlessly built into its wall and the empty glass tube, it was totally bare. But the concept of cell meant nothing to her: the only thing that she was struggling to come to terms with was that this was her new reality. Her shivering body found a corner of the cell where, driven by instinct, she huddled against the wall, hugging her knees close to her chest. Her wet fur dripped amniotic fluids onto the smooth ground, forming a pool around her. She shivered.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Her first breaths in this world were shallow and fearful. Fear. Another new experience. She would later experience this fear again as more people entered her cell to remove the glass tube before leaving her alone again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She would also experience more emotions over time. Emotions embedded in instincts through generations of evolution.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>All of them.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>All of them except for happiness.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf slowly learnt what it meant to be alive. To stay alive.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Hunger needed to be met with food. Food in the form of a nutrient paste mechanically extruded onto the floor for her to eat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Fear needed to be met with shelter. Shelter in the form of a particular corner of the cell that she had grown accustomed to hiding in.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Brightness needed to be met with darkness. Darkness in the form of closing her eyes, wishing that she was back in the glass chamber and away from this place.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>These were things one typically learns from birth but when it came to the wolf, she might as well have just been born. She learnt to interact with the world around her. Stimuli from the outside. She takes action. Then more stimuli in response. Natural instinct was her teacher, imparting to her the skills she needed to survive.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But natural instinct taught her one more thing: the desire to escape.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Escape? What did such a concept entail? It required one to be able to perceive a place for which to escape to. A place which the wolf could not comprehend in her limited experience.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But it was still there. A desire, a hunger, a craving for freedom.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Freedom.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Unknown to the wolf, she was XN-1847-8272-1843: an identification number to distinguish objects. Identity was something that the wolf could not comprehend. In her mind, she wasn't "her". She just was.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But her identity as an object meant that she had a purpose. A purpose that someone out there had assigned to her. A purpose that would require her to be processed in order to fulfil. Which was why one ordinary day, the door to her cell opened and two technicians strode in, each one picking her by her upper arms and dragging her out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She knew not how to fight back. Instinct had not yet taught her the meaning of danger. Instead, fear flooded her thoughts once again as she was dragged into a new and alien world of white corridors, the walls of her reality once again broken as she was thrown into a bigger world.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She was brought to a room with a metal frame mounted on rails. Welded into it were metal cuffs which the wolf was methodologically secured in. They snapped in place, restraining her securely with her limbs splayed outwards in the shape of an "X". More clamps were closed around her, automatically locking themselves around her neck, elbow, and knees. A steel cage-like frame encased her torso, ending at rings around her shoulder and pelvic joints at her limbs.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A soft sound came out from the wolf's throat, half growl, half whimper: another product of her survival instinct, useless against her unyielding surroundings. The light was bright in her eyes, forcing her to squint and struggle helplessly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For the first time in her life, her mind—conveyed in a language only her mind could comprehend—conceived of a question: What were they doing to her? With her head securely restrained, her search for answers manifested in her frantically-darting eyes and her pleading yelps. Her actions would prove to be in vain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a jerk, the frame she was bound in started moving along the rails which led through a tall rectangular opening in the wall into pitch-black darkness. But unlike the first darkness, this one was not a comforting one. The brightness of the previous room was a splotch of light, disappearing as her body was dragged around a bend.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sounds. There were sounds. Her inexperience was too great to even grant her recognition of the whir and clangs of the machinery, all of them cloaked in the darkness. Only coloured spots of indicator lights could be seen, darting back and forth in the darkness like robotic fireflies.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf's heart was beating loudly in her chest. A physiological response to an emotional state. Fear. But that feeling was mixed with a second emotion: curiosity. She was curious about the moving lights in the darkness and her eyes followed their rigid choreography and angular turns in the midst of the void.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Then two beams of green light shone over her spreadeagle body: one in front and one behind, scanning her body. Reading her contours and measuring her dimensions. Her form reduced to mere numbers just as her identity had been.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Without warning, her body was assaulted with the sprays from dozens of unseen nozzles around her. The stinging liquid clung to her fur, getting into her eyes and mouth. The wolf hastily closed them, trying to squeeze them out of her eyes as the taste of the caustic acid filled her mouth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Brushes reached out for her, scrubbing her fur and scouring her skin. The cleaning agent that had been sprayed onto her served to chemically burn the dirt and perspiration off her hide, all while creating a burning sensation on her skin.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mahhh! Mahhh! Mahhhhhhh!" she let out a series of whimpered cries, sustaining each one until her lungs ran out of air before she took another breath and repeated desperately.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The brushes fell away and a spray of cool solvent washed her fur. The solvent flushed away the stinging agent, leaving behind pink and sore skin beneath her white fur. Blasts of wind from unseen fans then dried her up, leaving the strong smell of antiseptic in the air.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Metal arms grabbed her shoulders, wrists, thighs, and ankles in their vice-like grips. The restraints on her body frame released her and the mechanical grips forced her limbs to bend. Her wrists were firmly pressed down to the back of her shoulders and the front of her feet were forced upwards to touch her rump. Steel rings were applied and welded in place, keeping her limbs permanently bent.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf sobbed loudly, afflicted by the pain of the restraints and the overwhelming fear. "Mahhh!" came her tortured screams, again and again. A blinking light slid mechanically in front of the wolf's face as if staring her in the eyes. Scared and crying, the wolf looked back at it hopefully. Was it here to help? Suddenly, the unseen arm advanced upon the wolf's face. Clamps closed around her maw, holding her muzzle in place with its painful grip. With a slow whirring of gears, it began prying her jaw open.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf tried to close her jaw but the cold steel was heartless and unyielding. Still, it didn't stop the wolf from trying. Her maw was shivering as she strained her muscles, tears forming in her eyes. The clamp opened her mouth wider and wider beyond the point of comfort and into an agonizing angle until it finally stopped.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Heeze!" the wolf wheezed helplessly. Her tail was writhing around as her body struggled to escape. There was a sharp pain in her nose as two robotic, semicircular tubes forced themselves into her nostrils and into her nasal cavity.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mah-!" she tried to call for help but a hollow tube was forced into her open maw, curving down to the back of her throat. A metal frame was shoved into her mouth, circling the tube as it held her jaws open. A claw grabbed her writhing tongue, painfully stretching it out to the front of her lower jaw and keeping it from moving.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mhhh!" she screamed with a muffled voice. For the discomfort to stop. But the machine had no compassion for her shivering form as the tubes in her nose thrust further into her body, snaking down her throat until it reached the entrance of her windpipe and gullet. They forced past her epiglottis, past her vocal cords, and into her windpipe, causing the wolf to resist even harder than before.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The two tubes connected back to each other, forming a solid tube that went down her mouth and into her windpipe. Its tip began expanding until it filled the entire span of her trachea, securely lodging itself there.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A full, sleek, metal helmet was put over her head, securing the mouth gag and nose tubes in place. An electrical probe pierced the back of her neck and into her spinal cord, forming a mental link into the helmet. Arc welders sealed the metal together, making sure that nobody could take off the helmet. It would connect to her mind as well as feed visual input through displays in front of her eyes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A cylindrical, metal device was brought up to the wolf's crotch. Its base was covered with open ports that led up to its mechanical body, covered with metal connector nodes and ending at a tapered tip. Her body was shivering in fear, afraid of the menacing probe.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>In one sharp movement, the probe was shoved deep into her pussy. There was a hiss as the wide base sealed around the entirety of her clitoris, forming a shield with open ports. The largest one led up to a tube that led deep into her vagina.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Braces clamped around the lips of her hymen, keeping it permanently open with the device lodged firmly in her quivering hole. The device began vibrating in pulses, stimulating her sensitive insides.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Arousal. Her first arousal would be artificially induced in the midst of her brutal bodily mutilation.  Her whimpering gasps were an emotional mix of pain, fear, and unwilling arousal as her fluids began moistening her vaginal hole.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf's survival instincts were to thrash around. To fight back. To escape. But millennia of evolution had not prepared Mother Nature to face the onslaught of mechanical processing she was being subjected to. Instead, her instincts settled for inaudible cries that were drowned out by the sound of the machinery around her. Cries that were evolutionarily honed to call the attention of one's mother, one's caretaker. But objects were not granted this privilege. Objects had no rights to luxury. Objects had nothing.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A device similar to the first vaginal probe was pressed against her pucker, lubricated with industrial oil. It pushed against her tailhole and the wolf instinctively clenched her muscles. That only made the pain worse as in one sharp movement, the device was forcefully thrust past her muscles and into her.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The girthy shaft of the makeshift dildo pressed against her Skene glands, making her blush from the wave of sexual kindling. The tip of the device reached deep within her, filling out her insides near the entrance of her large intestines. The base of the device around her pucker expanded, clamping around the edges of her sphincter and keeping it permanently open with the device lodged firmly in her tight tailhole. The base of the device opened up to an internal tube, forming an entrance into the wolf's insides. Two large tubes were connected to the vaginal and anal ports with a hissing sound. The tubes were pulled to the back, neatly hung on the frame she was restrained in.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf was barely hanging on to her sanity as the modifications were made to her one after the other, with each additional modification turning her organic form into one consisting of cold, unyielding steel. </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The brace around her body suddenly opened up, leaving her to hang by her neck until a metal structure was immediately secured to her body. This one was fitted to her body, the precise result of her body measurements from earlier. It consisted of an inner frame that hugged the shape of her breasts and abs tightly, leading around to the back where a central column ran down her spine. Her breasts were constricted in a tight, rectangular-shaped frame and a neck brace kept her from turning as it connected to her steel hood. The outer frame was the shape of a cuboid, just big enough to contain the width and height of the body, made compact with its bent limbs.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Electric welders danced around her, welding everything in place and making her imprisonment permanent. The cables from her encased urethral, vaginal, and anal port were attached to a circular port at the back of the cuboid's outer frame, joined by the cerebral links as well as the nasal and oral tubes. Her tail was bound to her back by leather straps, keeping it completely immobile against her spine.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The metal frame was rotated so that she was facing up again and she was lowered into a padded box which closed around her. The wolf was left suspended in the air by the metal frame that locked her body in an immovable prison. The box was moved into a storage room and an opening in its back allowed cables and tubes to connect to the circular port behind the wolf's metal frame.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The life support system in her body was turned on and she suddenly found herself being fed a nutrient solution that flowed through the tubes and down her throat. A stream of air went down her nose tubes and straight into her lungs, dictating the speed of her breaths. The vaginal and anal device began vibrating, keeping her sexual organs constantly stimulated.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The object would later be used for her preordained purpose but in the meantime, she would be useful. The tube in her tailhole would flush away her organic waste from time to time and the device in her vagina would drain away her cervical fluids which would later be recycled for amino acid and protein synthesis.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And the whole time, the object would be kept in the dark.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Always in the dark.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf woke up from her feverish slumber. She noticed that the stimulation had stopped, giving her sexual relief for the first time in a very long time. She had been in this state for months until the pain became a part of her daily life so this respite came as something new.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But something felt different. It was as if her thoughts were shoved into a compartment of her mind, making space for something else in her brain. Despite the removal of her sight she tried to open her eyes again. Unlike the previous times, this time her vision was flooded with a plethora of information. Numbers and images filled her mind.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She examined the images one at a time. They depicted a world that she had not seen before. A world somewhere out there. She watched them with a sense of wonder and curiosity. The images were moving. More specifically, the people in the images were moving. There were three thousand, seven hundred and fifty-five people in the building.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>People. Numbers. Building. These were new concepts to her but yet somehow she understood them completely. Unbeknownst to her, she was installed into a skyscraper as its security mainframe. With it came a knowledge module that was installed into her mental link. Her mind was connected to the computers in a server room, allowing her to access to all the relevant information required to carry out her tasks.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The system was feeding her information. The building had one hundred and seventy storeys, one hundred and fifty of them above the ground and twenty below. Above the ground, most of the floors consisted of office floors and meeting rooms. The floors underground housed the operational aspects of the building: racks of computational servers, air-conditioning units, backup power generators, and so on.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Serving these floors were forty-six elevators arranged in an intricate network around the building to spread out the congestion. Security posts were located around the building's many entrances and on various floors throughout the building. Robotic drones guarded the entrances and patrolled the corridors.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And she was in charge of this entire system.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She watched moving images, slowly understanding what they were: live feed from the thousands of security cameras throughout the building. She was to look out for signs of threats: dangerous individuals, unidentifiable objects, building fires, and so on. And should anything happen, she could lock down the various doors and shutters to isolate the threat or utilize the robotic drones to neutralize said threat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She watched through a camera feed as a sleek, metallic black robot walked down the corridor in the midst of people in business suits, streaming from both directions.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>What if she...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As the thought materialized in her head, she suddenly found herself looking through the eyes of the robot. She was standing still in the middle of the corridor with people bumping against her as they strode swiftly by, so busy that they had no time to apologize. What good was apologizing to a robot, anyway?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Ignoring the annoyed glances of people for her obstruction of the path, she looked down at her body. It was made out of sleek and streamlined curves, forming a genderless frame of reinforced steel. She brought her hand to her face, twisting her wrists and bending her fingers. She was in a body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Her heartbeat sped up in her organic chest. A long-forgotten instinct was coming back to her: the hunger for freedom. But along with it came with a new feeling: hope. Guided by the floor plans installed in her mind, she turned around made for the elevator.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A small jolt of electricity surged through her body and the robot halted in its tracks. Pain. The system was punishing her with pain for needlessly deviating from the patrol. The wolf winced and turned around. Its patrol would lead down another corridor, taking a weaving path through more corridors before looping back to this spot. Going down rows of office cubicles, she continued down the assigned route and a slow vibrating started in her crotch, stimulating her. Sexual stimulation was to be her reward.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf felt shame. Shame for being a slave to her sexual stimulation. Shame for her helplessness to escape. Shame for her entire existence. She guided the robot, winding through the corridors as she watched out for signs of suspicious activity. Nothing.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Her journey led her past another set of elevators. She needed to do this. A pair of lift doors opened and people started stepping out of it. Without waiting for them to get off, she pushed past them and stood in the elevator to the disdain of the other passengers. The electrical shocks got stronger, making her convulse in her metal frame. The robot she was controlling was shuddering too, twitching in time with her physical body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The elevator went up first, dropping off groups of passengers until it reached the top floor. Once it was empty, the wolf overrode the elevator system, making it descend past the other floors as it headed for the ground floor. With a gentle ping, its doors slid open and the trembling robot stumbled out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Trying to endure the agony, she quickly made for the exit. People turned their heads to look at the runaway robot as it ran down a corridor, past the main lobby, and out the double glass doors. The pain seemed to disappear as she was greeted by a dazzling orb of brightness that hung in a void of warm orange and pale blue.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She was watching the sunrise.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Her heart was beating in her chest and throbbing in her head. This was her escape. She ignored the pain as she made her way down the concrete pavement in jittery movements. The pain be damned, she was going to be free.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The numbers in her head told her that she was soon to be out of the building's compound. Just a bit more pain. Just a few more steps...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The robot crumpled to the ground as the system ousted it from the security network. The wolf was back in her dark world, watching the moving images in front of her. In one of them, a black robot was lying on the pavement in front of the building with its limbs splayed out haphazardly on the concrete. It laid there for a few minutes before it slowly came to life, getting up and returning to the building.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf mentally whimpered.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She was trapped here.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Until her physical body was extracted from the building, she was trapped here.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A black robot walked down the corridor of one of the basement floors. Unlike the well-furnished office corridors above ground, the basement levels felt sterile with their smooth, white walls and floor. The robot turned around a corner and carried down another long corridor, slightly trembling as it went down a route that it was not meant to be on.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>This floor housed the security system. Robots came here to charge when their power ran low. But instead of heading to the room with charging ports, it opened the door marked "Security Mainframe".</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The room was filled with rows and rows of server racks. This was where the camera feeds were processed and where the robots were being controlled. Cables from the top of the racks were bundled together, leading towards the centre of the room. The robot followed them, getting closer and closer to the middle of the huge room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And the robot came to the central point of the room. In its middle was a cuboidal metal frame mounted on a pedestal, securing the spreadeagle body of a white wolf in its middle. Cables and tubes ran out the back of the frame, connecting to the various wires in the room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>This was her body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But there was no time to fret. The robot had with it a wireless link device meant to turn a physical cable connection into a wireless one. The wolf sent instructions to the drone to unplug her body from the mainframe before linking them back through the wireless device.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The world went black as the drone disconnected her from the system. Her breathing was suddenly unassisted by the air pumps and she found herself having to use her diaphragm to keep herself alive. She had been hooked up to the system for three years now, getting increasingly reliant on the life support that the building provided her with.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>To her relief, the feed of thousands of cameras returned to her vision. She was connected back to the system, albeit with a bit of lag as the signals had to travel through waves in the air before it reached her mind.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There were no cameras in the security mainframe room but the wolf knew the robot's ID. She connected to the robot, once again able to see her body. A black transceiver module was mounted on the back of her frame and a similar one was hooked up to the cables. Her breathing still had to be done manually but it was a small price to pay for freedom.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Looking through the eyes of her robot, she took the body down and shoved it in a huge, canvas bag that the robot had brought along. The wolf could feel the air go stale and suffocating around her as its opening was zipped shut. Then she picked herself up, carrying the cuboid-shaped bag close to her chest as she made for the door.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The robot ran up the stairs, skipping two steps at a time as it ascended to the first floor. Trying to blend in with the crowd, it slowed down to a walking pace as it made its way through the crowd. The robot would shut down once it left the boundary of the building but she would cross the bridge when she came to it: she needed to get to freedom first.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Then there was the sound of shouting. Someone was pointing at her. The security modules didn't teach her language but she knew enough to tell that she was in trouble. She threw caution to the winds, pushing past people as she ran for the exit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She was out through the double doors and bolting down the pavement. She just needed to get to the boundary. Her pursuers were hot on her heels but she was faster. Just a bit more...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The outside world disappeared as the security system kicked the robot from the network again and her bagged body was thrown down the pavement and out the gates of the compound. Her vision was once again filled with rows of security feed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But she was out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She was free.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Her heart was beating in excitement. Her head was throbbing from the adrenaline. She was free.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But she was also trapped. Unable to do anything. She listened to the sound of her laboured breathing. What now?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Suddenly, she could feel her body being moved. The sounds indicated that the bag was being unzipped but she could not see a thing. She switched her feed over to the security camera pointed at her, only to see people in uniform standing around her metal frame.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She had been caught.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>They examined the metal transceiver on her back. Then a look of recognition flashed across their faces as they figured out what it was doing. Through her ears, she could hear their voices around her, speaking in words that she could not understand. One of the men bent down and disconnected it from her system and everything went black.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf continued listening to her breaths. What was going to happen to her? To answer her question, a gaseous anaesthetic was fed into her nasal tubes and put the wolf to sleep.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf was woken up by an intense feeling of pain and pleasure that consumed her entire being. Electrical pulses were surging through her body, making it hard to think or even control her body's convulsing. But at the same time, her privates were still being stimulated at the devices' maximum intensity. The conflicting sensations assaulted her senses relentlessly, making it unbearable for her. She was gasping in pain, producing her inaudible cries for mercy.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was a click sound and the feed of thousands of cameras flooded her vision again. Despite the cruel punishment, she was still required to perform her security duties. And no matter what she did, the torture would not stop. It was to be her eternal torment for attempting to escape.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Saying that the wolf was in pain would be an understatement. It was pure suffering for her, both physically and mentally. She had came so close to escaping, only to have it taken away. Should she have made sure that she had a proper escape plan beyond the compound limits? Sure, but she didn't know any better.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And now all she had left to look forward to was a lifetime of physical anguish.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>No.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She could not stand for that. She needed to escape again. She controlled the robot closest to the server mainframe and made her way to the room, violently shuddering the entire way. She threw open the door to the security room and ran down to where her body should be.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But instead of her body, she saw a block of solid metal. Its dimensions were the same as that of the cuboid frame that had contained her body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>No...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She stumbled to the back of the solid block and sure enough, wires and cables ran out the back of the metal cuboid. As if to add salt to the wound, her white, bushy tail was visible through an opening near the base of the block. It was pointed upwards and compressed against the metal surface by a glass plate that was adhered in place. What was left of her organic being was reduced to a mocking display.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The robot crumpled to the ground, convulsing as she mourned her fate. Evolution had blessed, no, cursed her with emotions. She was feeling agony. But along with that came one last, new emotion: grief.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She was in grief.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf was not aware of how long her robotic form had been there when she regained lucidity. She stumbled to her feet, still convulsing as she made her way over to the server racks. Driven entirely by her grief, she punched through the glass windows, damaging the computing units inside. Her vision flickered as backup units were activated to replace the broken ones.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But the wolf didn't stop. The robot went over to another row of units and destroyed them too. Her vision was slowly getting fuzzy. There was a spark. And the spark went on to create an electrical fire. Still, she continued her rampage, destroying everything in sight.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was harder and harder to control the robot as the security mainframe was damaged beyond repair. The fire was starting to consume the entire room, filling it with smoke. The robot stumbled over to the centre of the room, next to the metal block.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With one last effort, it tore the cables off and disconnected her from the security mainframe. The live feed was cut off and her breathing had to be manually controlled now. But each breath she took was filled with smoke and carbon monoxide. It was suffocating.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And it was dark.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She coughed and choked on the suffocating air as her head swam around. It felt like her senses were fading away. The pain. The pleasure. Slowly dimming into the blackness.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Her world, her reality was getting darker and darker around her as she faded out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was dark. So, very, very dark.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ End ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
