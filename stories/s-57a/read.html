He is bound to a bench, teased to erection, and a cock ring keeps his cock up. He is vacuum packed by a latex sack, and heating elements melt the latex onto him. Only a tube in his mouth lets him breathe. This process was repeated until Cloud is reduced to a faceless bench with his cock erect.\nCloud's bench-bound latex body is brought to the Silver Serpent lounges for the guests to make use of. A female naga, Kamelia, plays with him by cutting off his air supply when she covers the tube. She then abuses his inability to orgasm by jacking him off. After that, she puts Cloud upright and fucks herself on his dick. After she orgasms, she smears her ejaculate over his face before leaving him to other patrons of the casino.

    <div id="story-form"><div class="story-container"><div class="story"><p class="title align-left">From One to Another - Part 1</p><p class="subtitle align-left">Written by TwistedSnakes</p><p class="subtitle align-left">Commissioned by Cloud-Tail</p><div class="title-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>In the middle of one of the many gambling rooms of the Silver Serpent stood Cloud the sabretooth snow leopard. Chandeliers of gold and crystal hung from an unseen ceiling, hidden by swirling holographic clouds.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Gambling tables were arranged in neat clusters throughout the grand room, each of them filled with gamblers testing the extent of their luck and wealth at the high-stakes tables of the greatest bondage casino in the world. Only the most skilful and luckiest of them will ever achieve the rank of Master Gambler. </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Yet the privilege and prestige that comes with the position never fail to entice thousands of gamblers to try anyway. Cloud was among the few lucky ones. Two years of gambling during his holiday trips to the casino has earned him his ranks among the other Master Gamblers.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Now, however, he stood in front of a poker table that had been pushed over. Its mahogany tabletop was split down the middle, caused by the weight of its hefty body against its delicately-carved sides. Cards were strewn haphazardly over the floor: the jumbled remains of an interrupted poker game. The other players had got off their seats and moved away from the fallen table, and the dealer was three steps away from his original post, just enough to prevent the corner of the table from turning his dress shoes and feet into a bloody mess on the ground.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Everyone in the room was staring at the snow leopard. The dealer of the broken table regarded him with a cold glare. It wasn't an angry look, but it was something far worse. It made Cloud feel like he had just done something really terrible, not knowing the full consequences of his actions.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As he tried to shrug off the uneasy feeling, he realized that his shoulders were tensed up and he tried to relax them. Perhaps it was an impulsive fit of anger. Or it could've been his dwindling balance in his bank account. Or maybe he was stressed that his three-day losing streak was going to cost him his title of Master Gambler.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Either way, what's done is done, and the remnants of the poker game that would never be completed laid before him. He might've mumbled some words of apology. He might've even offered to pay for it. He didn't remember.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>What Cloud did remember, however, was that two burly guards came to bring him away. Away into the ominous depths of the Silver Serpent.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>They say there are only two reasons you'd ever find yourself in the staff sectors of the Silver Serpent. The first is if you've done well in your gambling endeavours. Most casinos would then throw you out for making them lose money. Not the Silver Serpent. Here, your successes are celebrated by the casino itself, granting you the elusive title of Master Gambler. Cloud had been in this position a year ago, being bestowed the grand title in a private ballroom among many prominent executives and gamblers of the casino. He was sure he wasn't here for that purpose this time around.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The second reason is if you've owed the Silver Serpent a great debt that is beyond your capacity to repay. And the Silver Serpent is here to collect. And when the debt is easier to comprehend as the number of the jet planes the money could buy than the full amount spelt out, the casino has alternative ways to collect that which is owed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>These thoughts plagued the snow leopard's mind as he sat stiffly in the leather chair in a fancy office, furnished with modern shelves and minimalistic lamps. A sleek chair with streamlined curves stood behind an avant-garde block of black marble that served as a desk. A gold-plated nameplate stood on the desk, declaring the owner of the office to be Javek Feathertail, the Chief Operating Officer of the casino.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cloud let his eyes wander over the room's furniture until a blue-furred tern entered the office, wearing a slim, white business suit. He walked past the snow leopard and behind his desk but did not sit down. Instead, he spread the reports and notes on his table and gave them a cursory glance before looking up to face Cloud.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah, Mr Argen," Javek declared, beginning to pace around the room. The snow leopard shifted uncomfortably in his seat. It wasn't a question, but it wasn't quite a statement either.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"In 1942, the passenger ship SS Leviathan set sail on a voyage like any other," Javek began, "But five days into its eight-day journey, the ship sent out an SOS signal. Then it was never heard from again."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cloud was confused. What was this conversation leading to? Still, not wanting to aggravate his situation, he kept silent.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Its wreckage was later found in the Panotha Sea Mine Barrage. Blown to bits by the leftovers mines of the Fifth War," the tern continued, "Rumour has it the captain shot the officers and navigator in the ship's bridge. Then he steered the ship off its original course and into the minefield.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Its passengers were none the wiser; it was only when the second captain came up to the bridge for his shift did he find the ship's second captain came up to find the bridge door locked did someone notice something was wrong. I'm sure he must've done everything he could to save the ship. Spread instructions for passengers to get into lifeboats, stopped the powering of the steam engine. He had no access to the ship's public announcement system to tell the passengers what to do. No access to the telegraphs to tell the engineers to stop. No access to the helm of the ship to direct it back on track. Things are much harder when you're not in control, don't you think?" Javek paused his pacing to consider Cloud with a smug grin. The snow leopard looked back in confusion.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The rest is history. The ship was sunk by a mine, and there were only three hundred survivors out of its two thousand passengers. Nobody dared to venture into the mine-infested waters to rescue the rest of the survivors.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Apart from the disjointed stories of eyewitness accounts, we don't know much about the disaster. We never even found out what drove the captain to do what he did that fateful day. All we have left of the ship are its survivors, their stories, and..." he trailed off as if to add some dramatic effect, "and three artefacts.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The first artefact was a golden candlestick that a passenger smuggled with her as she boarded the lifeboats. It's since been donated to the National Museum where it now stands, collecting dust. The second and third were pieces of furniture that had floated out of the minefield region, recovered by the rescue ships which waited on its fringes for hours, hoping to find more survivors. There was a deck chair made of oak, now owned by collector and a good friend of mine in his Primá Mansion.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The last artefact just so happens to be a beautiful mahogany table. A body so sturdy it puts today's plastic furniture to shame, hand-carved motifs so intricate in their curves and edges, a finish so brilliant it looks brand new even decades after it was made."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cloud's hands gripped the sides of his armrests and fingers curled around its edges. Beads of cold sweat formed on his brow.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And so we bought it. Handpicked it myself. A way of commemorating the tragedy that was the sinking of the SS Leviathan. For years, it stood proudly in one of our many game rooms, functioning as a poker table for players like you to indulge yourselves in the culture and heritage of old.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Until you came along."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Javek heaved a heavy sigh as he shook his head. "Devastating. A huge loss for history and culture," he paused for a second before looking Cloud straight in the eyes, "So how do you intend to right such a travesty of a wrong?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Uhh," the snow leopard mumbled, "I have no idea. I'll leave that up to you."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Sure," Javek nodded, and Cloud could've sworn a smirk flash across the tern's face for a split second, "I already have something in mind."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The doors behind Cloud opened and two guards walked in. "Follow my men," Javek instructed. Cloud got off his seat. His heart was beating loudly in his chest as a feeling of dread and regret welled up within him. He shouldn't have agreed to Javek's proposal. But what else could he have done? Once they had you, there was no escaping the Silver Serpent.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The guards led him out of Javek's office. As he left the office, the tern spoke his parting words, "Master Gambler or not, the Silver Serpent always collects its debts." Then the doors closed behind him.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cloud soon found himself in a white room lined with smooth, shiny ceramic tiles. There was only one entrance into the room, which was the doorway he came in from. A black pane of glass was set into the wall, meant for people to look into the room without being seen themselves. A lab staff, a rhino sporting a black uniform, followed him in and a door materialized in the doorway, sealing the room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A ceramic square base sat in the middle of the room and a matching cuboidal cover was suspended on mechanical arms coming from the ceiling. When activated, the cover would come in and enclose the base's occupants within it. Tubes hung down menacingly from the inside of the cover. In the middle of the ceramic base was a steel bench with metal clamps built into its frame in various locations. Cloud didn't like the look of it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As if detecting room's visitors, panels in the walls opened up, offering an array of devices and tools. Gags, vibrators, latex suits, and more sat on racks or hung from hooks.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Strip," the rhino instructed, and the snow leopard complied reluctantly, tossing his clothes into a pile in front of him, which the rhino kicked to the side.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Lie down on the bench," came the next command and Cloud hesitated for a moment before stepping up to the square base and getting onto it. The bench was just long enough to support his head down to his hips, which the snow leopard soon found out as he laid face-up on it. He was facing the dark underside of the machine's cover, barely making out the tubes and pipes running along its sides.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yip!" he gasped in surprise as clamps around his neck and waist were closed around his body. There were whirring sounds as the automated locking mechanisms in the clamps interlocked, rendering them unopenable without the release command. Cloud instinctively tugged against them, feeling a sense of nervousness rise within him as they refused to let him move more than a few inches beyond his current position.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His arms and legs were pulled back and his wrists and ankles were clamped to the ends of the bench's legs. His tail was pulled under the bench and secured into place too. Cloud felt as if he was being integrated into the bench itself with his body being contorted like that.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The rhino picked up a vibrating wand, flicked it on, and brought it close to Cloud. "What are you going to do to-ah!" the snow leopard gasped as the vibrating end of the wand was firmly pressed against the underside of his cock.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"W-wait! Please!" he pleaded as his sensitive member was teased with the wand as it was rubbed up and down the length of his shaft as well as pushed against his balls. His squirms got him nowhere as his movement was restricted by the tight and rigid clamps that held him in place.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His dick rose to full erection in a matter of seconds under the skilful hands of the rhino, quivering as his arousal drove him to grind against the wand. The teasing and stimulation went on and on, turning Cloud's concerns for his fate into anticipation for his climax.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His cock was twitching as he was about to shoot his load. Suddenly, his climax was interrupted by tension around the base of his erect dick. "What the-" Cloud strained his neck to look at his crotch. The rhino had slipped on a tight, rubber cock ring around his manhood, preventing his much-needed orgasm from happening.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Gah!" he grunted in annoyance but the rhino ignored him. Before he could react, a latex sack was wrapped over his bench-bound form, encasing him in the rubbery material and plunging him into darkness. A tube in the latex was pushed into his mouth, allowing him to breathe in the sack. Robbed of his senses, he kept still and listened to the rapid beating of his heart.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He could hear the cover descend around him, enclosing him in the machine. Without warning, the deafening sound of a vacuum pump filled his ears and the latex sack began to constrict around him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft!" Cloud grunted nervously, unable to open his mouth as the rubber squeezed his jaws together. Then the feel of heat engulfed him as the heating elements in the machine turned on. "Hfft!" he shouted louder as the latex began to melt, fusing to his fur. His rubber-encased body thrashed on the metal bench as he began to understand what was going on.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was being encased in latex: Cloud knew that much. But what was he being turned into? Why were they doing this to him?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was a hissing sound as the cover was lifted up, allowing the cool air of the outside to harden the rubber around him. Cloud could feel the cool relief around him, followed by the sensation of being wrapped in another layer of latex. The mouth tube filled his lungs with the overpowering scent of fresh latex, making him slightly dizzy.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hnggf?" he yelled anxiously, the rubber around his face effectively muzzling him and muffling his voice. His efforts to struggle were valiant but futile: the metal was not about to yield. The cover went back over his latex-coated form and the outer layer of rubber was sucked against his skin. More heat was applied, melting the second layer of latex onto the first.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft!" Cloud groaned in pain. His member was twitching as the constricting latex pressed the cock ring tighter against the base of his firm shaft. Breathing was starting to be harder as the layer of latex around him got thicker, making it harder to inhale the steaming air within the heating chamber.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Another hiss, then the respite as cool air rushed into his lungs. Cloud was shivering in fear and pain, trembling against the metal bonds that held him in place. There was something incredibly unbelievable about what they were doing to him. Something so inhumane, the snow leopard could barely come to terms with it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His could feel his vulnerable body being wrapped by yet another layer of latex. Then the machine went back to melt it over the struggling snow leopard. His helpless whines got increasingly muffled as his new latex skin got thicker and thicker around his bound body. His writhing slowed down as it became harder and harder to twist and turn his body within his hefty encasement. It was quickly becoming his new skin as the machine was lifted up, allowing the cool air to harden the black rubber around him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His head was now featureless. A faceless toy, reduced to a piece of furniture. But his visible struggles only indicated he needed more coatings. Another layer of latex followed by a round of heating within the machine. Again and again, Cloud was subjected to the immense coatings and heat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It felt like hours later when Cloud's ordeal finally ended. He felt a deep sense of fatigue from his incessant struggles and enduring of the heat. His pitiful whimpers were muffled beneath his new skin as it cooled and vulcanized around his body, seamlessly binding him to the bench he was restrained to. In fact, he looked less like a feline bound to a bench and more like a bench moulded to look like a feline. His limbs formed the legs of the bench with his head at one end and his erect dick at the other.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a surgical cutter, the rhino cut the trailing end of Cloud's breathing tube, making the snow leopard's face blank except for the tiny breathing hole that was left. His weak tremblings could barely be seen from beneath the thick coating of latex. The rhino gripped the base of Cloud's cock firmly, slowly stroking upwards until he was giving his tapered cock a solid squeeze.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft..." his yelp could barely be heard.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Good.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The piece of furniture was completed.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Unable to see anything from the inside of his rubber prison, Cloud could only feel the cool ventilation of the air conditioners through his breathing hole and his latex skin. The familiar sounds around him told him that he was in a lounge of some sort in the Silver Serpent. Resting areas for when gamblers were tired or simply looking for a way to satiate their sexual cravings.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cloud whined softly. He was a sex toy to meet those needs.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sure enough, he soon felt soft hands caressing the curves of his rubber-encased pecs and abs. With his mouth sealed shut, he could only respond with his shudders. Despite the thick layer of latex around his body, the touch still felt stimulating as if it were stroking his bare skin.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ngnn..." he shivered and groaned. His member throbbed relentlessly, stuck standing with the cock ring that kept his erection from dissipating.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What a cute little chair you are," a female voice purred. The voice belonged to Kamelia, a naga with the lower body of a snake and the upper body of a leopard. Her hands found their way to either side of Cloud's shoulders as she sat on his muscular chest, feeling his warm pecs beneath the supple scales of her serpentine body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cloud moaned in response. The dulling of all his other senses only made her sensual touches feel even more erotic as his inner arousal began to override his sense of reason. Despite being an unwilling-captive-turned-latex-toy, he wanted to be stroked more. Her hands traced the curves of his chest, circling his areolas until the snow leopard was gasping involuntarily.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kamelia purred in response, enjoying the arousal she was causing the snow leopard to feel. Her hands gave his shoulders a squeeze before going up to his shoulders, neck, and to his muzzle where the tube was. With two fingers, she covered the breathing hole over his mouth, cutting off Cloud's intake of air. His next inhale caused him to choke as he tried to suck in air but ended up creating a suction that pressed the latex firmly against his face.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft!" he tried to twist his head away but the thick rubber prevented his movements from going too far from his neutral position. He began panicking as he tried to hold his breath. His entire body was thrashing within what little give the latex would allow, making his erect dick shudder with his movements.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Just as he thought his lungs would burst, the naga took her hand off his mouth tube, allowing him to breathe again. His panting was laboured with the naga's weight on his chest but the oxygen was a welcome relief.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hff hff hff," Cloud wheezed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Aww, was toy worried?" Kamelia cooed, "Don't worry, I'll take very good care of you." The snow leopard felt a pang of concern, but with that came a feeling of anticipation. He was worried, yes, but his carnal instincts craved more stimulation. Sweet, sexual, stimulation. His rubber cock twitched again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The naga adjusted herself so that she was resting her derrière on Cloud's rubber abs and facing his eager cock. She stroked his staff from its quivering tip, down its underside, until her finger was touching the base of his shaft.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Wearing a cock ring, toy?" she mused aloud. She gripped the base of his dick, squeezing it firmly to press the ring against his throbbing flesh. The rubber cock ring had melted into the layers above, making it a permanent part of his latex prison.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She began jerking him off, feeling the smooth rubber slip between the tight tunnel she formed with her fingers. Cloud's reaction was immediate: his gasps were escaping his breathing tube and his hips were trying their best to thrust into her hands.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"F-fuck," he thought as his inhibitions crumbled under the intoxicating bliss that was flooding his mind. He could feel her fingers move up to his sensitive cock head, squeezing tightly against the ridge of his glans as she made her way up to his tip.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kamelia pumped harder and harder, faster and faster. She could feel the throbbing member get firmer in her skilful hands, almost ready to serve her sexual needs. "Almost there, kitty," she purred.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cloud was lost in his euphoria, feeling his cock being serviced as he shuddered against his inescapable bonds. But before he could climax, the naga took her hands off his rod.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft?" he yelped pleadingly. He wanted to cum!</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kamelia traced her fingers around the rigid cock ring around Cloud's shaft. "Toys don't need to have fun," she taunted the snow leopard, "Toys don't need to cum." Cloud let out a soft whimper, humping the air as he tried to stimulate himself.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, let's see if your useless cock is still good for something."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kamelia's hands pushed herself off Cloud's body and she slithered back to examine the bench reduced to a squirming mess, desperate for an orgasm she wasn't about to give. With a heave, she lifted up the bench so that the snow leopard's body was upright. Her mighty tail assisted her as she dragged Cloud's bench-bound body to the closest wall and leaned him against it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cloud's body was now on display, making him fully vulnerable as his rod stood eagerly erect. Kamelia licked her lips, admiring the snow leopard's rubber body like a predator regarding her prey. She coiled her tail around the snow leopard's feet as she closed in on the helpless feline.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>She stood face to face with the snow leopard, looking into his latex-clad face where his eyes should be. His entire face was black and shiny, smooth and featureless. Cloud had no way of looking back at her but that was exactly how she preferred it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kamelia's pussy was feeling moist and hungry. She gripped the feline's cock at its base, directing it into her snatch as she pressed her crotch against his.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mmm..." she moaned as she tensed her muscles, squeezing her internal flesh against the latex phallus within her and eliciting a gasp from Cloud. The snow leopard was humping her as if his dick was the dildo of a rapid fuck-machine. She rocked her hips in return, letting the lips of her cunt grip the shaft of his sceptre as she milked it for all its worth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cloud was squirming and thrusting his hips, still desperate to climax from his earlier arousal. His breathing was shallow, coming out in little huffs as his attention was focused entirely on the sensations of his relentlessly-fucked cock.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kamelia was letting her euphoria take over too, giving in to her sexual instincts as she hugged the snow leopard's chest and ground her hips against his. Her quivering pussy was leaking fluids, lubricating the latex dick and making each penetration increasingly pleasurable.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Harder, toy," she panted as she devoured Cloud's helpless cock, feeling the sensual surface of the latex inside her as its rubber head pressed against her G-spot. "Nfft!" she moaned. Cloud was also getting incredibly aroused, moaning in muffled gasps as he felt the tension rise within him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was a loud gasp as the naga's cunt tensed with her climax. She gave three hard thrusts as she squirted her thick fluids all over the shaft of the snow leopard. Her eyes glazed over as she grinned and indulged in the afterglow.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Cloud, however, was panting desperately. His climax was halted by the rubber ring around his cock, refusing to give him any relief to his sexual frustration. "Mfft!" he protested and squirmed. The thick rubber around his body felt even more constricting than before and the restraints around his arms were preventing him from helping himself to a session of jerking off. All he could do was whine.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kamelia smirked, taking in the snow leopard's agitation. "Ah, that felt really good," she teased, running her fingers between the folds of her labia and collecting some of her dripping fluids in her hands. Then she smeared it over Cloud's latex face, letting him smell the scent of her sexual pheromones through his breathing tube.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Guess your dick was useful for something after all," she grinned, giving the naturally-lubricated phallus one last squeeze before she stepped back and scanned the room. Guests had been watching the entire scene play out in the comfort of their chairs, although some of them were getting up and making their way over to have a turn at Cloud.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'll leave you to them then," Kamelia purred, stroking Cloud's fluid-stained cheek one more time before she slithered away, leaving the snow leopard to the other patrons in his predicament of helpless denial.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ To be continued ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
