Just long enough to wind down after the last day of work for the week, and far enough from the Monday dread that seems to ruin the final hours of Sundays. Something about the way the warm sunlight feels soft as it filters through the delicate linen curtains, a soothing contrast to the cool air of the room's air conditioning.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was afternoons like these that make Saben Swifmor want to indulge in its enchanting spell. To satiate his cravings. To turn a pleasant afternoon into a euphoric one. The cheetah's anticipation grew in the crotch of his slender one-piece swimsuit as he gave it a gentle grope. Made of lycra, it was sleek and smooth. Red lines flowed down its black and grey material, emphasizing Saben's supple curves of his body as it hugged his lithe figure.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>This was a good afternoon, but it was just about to get better.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He got out of the bathroom, letting the steamy air escape into the cool and crisp air of his bedroom that brushed against his thoroughly-cleaned fur. Then he swiftly pounced upon the silky sheets of his king-sized bed, pressing his face into the thick comforters of his bed, nuzzling against its cool surface with his warm cheeks.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Saben let himself bask in the smell of the freshly-laundered sheets: the homely smell of starch mixed with the light smell of lavender, before lifting his head up and letting the glow of the sun catch his face. He would've let himself drift off for an afternoon nap if not for the fun he had in store for himself.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Reaching under his bed, he pulled out a box with the picture of a bright blue orca on it. It was the pool toy he had ordered online a few weeks ago, only to be delivered three days before. He had allowed himself one brief examination of the toy when he first received it, but as much as he wanted to blow it up there and then, he knew he would have to curb his indulgence if he were to properly savour it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The days leading up to this momentous Saturday were agonizing to the point that there were times that Saben regretted opening that box in the first place. The scent of PVC filling his lungs as he stole a breath of it as he pressed his nose in. The feeling of the glossy vinyl brushing against his brushed fur as he strokes its firm material. The enticing rubber valve at the base of its tail, inviting him to press his lips against the vinyl and to give it the breath of life.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But his self-control had paid off and now he had the whole afternoon to himself and his pool toy. His slender fingers worked the flaps of the box open and pulled the deflated orca out, laying it flat on top of his bed. While most people would take the easy way out and resort to electric pumps to inflate their pool toys, Saben loved to manually blow his toys up. The breathlessness in his lungs. The light dizziness in his head. The anticipating pulsations of his heart. The wait only made the eventual romp all the more exciting.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His lips closed around the orca's air valve, forming an airtight seal against the vinyl and he started blowing. There was the deep, hissing sound as the breath of his lungs streamed through the one-way valve and into the deflated chamber of the toy. The air made the PVC rise a little, but there was still some ways to go.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He took another breath and blew, emptying the warm contents of his lungs into the orca. And again. And again. His body worked like clockwork, his hands bringing the valve to his mouth as he exhaled, then pulling it away so he could take a deep breath and repeat the cycle over and over. It was second nature to him now.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Sure enough, the lightheadedness began to set in. An intoxicating veil over his mind as his eager member throbbed on the inside of his form-fitting lycra. The orca was slowly taking form, straightening out in front of him with each lungful of air he gave it. Saben pushed his hips forward, letting the stiffening vinyl rub against his bulge teasingly. His cock tensed up, pressing its quivering skin against the tight lycra as he brushed it along the inflating toy.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The firmer the toy got, the more it squeaked as it rubbed against his sheets and leathery paws. Its body was taking shape, along with its shiny tail and fins. He'd have let out a soft, involuntary moan if not for the preoccupation of his lungs with the toy.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But he was almost there.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a few more breaths, the toy was fully inflated. Saben closed the valve and laid the orca lengthwise in the middle of the bed with front facing towards the headboard and the curtained window. Its surface was firm with little give as he caressed its streamlined form; a satisfying pressure against his fingers.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The cheetah got up and straddled the body of the orca, kneeling on either side of its inflated form. "Squeak!" went the pool toy as the lycra of his sizable bulge rubbed against the vinyl; its high-pitched squeals seemed to reflect Saben's avid anticipation. The inflatable's back sank slightly due to his weight but otherwise, kept its streamlined form. Satisfied that it would hold his weight, Saben let himself rest fully on the toy as he grabbed its dorsal fin. The sensations gave him contrasting feelings. The soft, squishiness of the toy mixed in with the strength of the air pressure. There was no denying the thrill he was feeling.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He thrust his hips forward, digging his lycra-clad bulge into the vinyl. "F-fuck," he gasped softly, biting his lower lip as he tried to stifle his moan. He wasn't going to go all out with it yet. Slow and steady. The pleasure would follow. But the firm feeling of the PVC pressing in against his keen cock, rubbing against the lycra, was riling up his libido.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Driven by his sexual instincts, Saben leaned forward until he was hugging the orca's body, eliciting its soft, charming squeaks. The air pressure in the inflatable toy pushed against its vinyl material, pressing it against the supple curves of the cheetah's chest and abs. He lifted his legs off the bed, squeezing them around the tail of the orca. The shifting of his body displaced air within the toy, perturbing the pressure and causing Saben's member to yearn for more.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Letting his body thrust against the rocking pool toy, he began grinding his generous bulge against the orca's back. Its cool surface started to heat up with the friction of his thrusts, enhancing his arousal as his cock and balls rubbed against the lycra and vinyl. He nuzzled against the fin of the orca in time with his grinding, feeling its smooth and glossy surface brushing against his cheek. His sensitive nipples, firm under his lycra swimsuit, was kneading against the pool toy.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mm..." he moaned passionately. The sensual feeling of the vinyl surface against his face. His chest. His arms. His legs. It felt like his body was being engulfed by the tenacious material as it wrapped around his torso and limbs, not to mention the pressure against his bulge.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His round and shapely rump rose with each of his humps, showing off the sleek curves of his body. His tail weaved through the beams of sunlight in the air, driven by his frenzied enthusiasm. The entire scene was a spontaneous dance of silky sheets, smooth fur, supple lycra, and squeaky vinyl, blending together to work Saben into a state of intoxicating arousal. His moans of arousal a harmonious symphony with the squeaking of the pool toy as they both craved for more.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With one hand groping his crotch, the cheetah adjusted his shaft so that it was pointed upwards against his abs, giving the pool toy full access to his cock and balls. Then he continued his humping with renewed vigour, filling the room with his moans of arousal and the toy's enthusiastic squeaks. His kitten-makers were tensed and tight in their lycra pouch as they were fondled by the orca's shiny back. The brushing of the toy against the underside of Saben's cock only stirred his arousal further, sending erotic shivers up his spine.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Squeak, squeak, squeak!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The more he humped, the closer to the edge it pushed him. He put his knees back on the bed and sat upright, allowing his bulge to nudge deeper into the vinyl. His fingers traced up his pecs and to his areolae, fondling each of them in turn through his swimsuit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"F-fuck..." Saben gasped involuntarily. If he had been holding back before, he certainly wasn't now. His thrusts were passionate and unbridled, pushing fervently against the toy as it squeaked in pleasure with each rock. Keeping one hand on the orca's fin, he used the other to give his nipples soft and drawn-out pinches as he switched from one to the other.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The head of his sensitive dick repeatedly nudged against the vinyl as it squeaked in response. His pants were heavy breaths in the cool air of the room. His mind was flooded with pure euphoria and ecstasy; he was getting extremely close to the inevitable release.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"A-ah!" he gasped. Sure enough, he shot his load inside his swimsuit, shuddering as he did so. He sustained his humps for a few more seconds before letting them subside as he caught his breath. His lips broke into a satisfied grin as he relaxed, resting his weight onto the body of the pool toy.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A soft, calming sense of fatigue washed over him and he leaned on the orca, feeling its cool, vinyl surface against his face and body, a contrasting sensation to the warm afterglow he was feeling, the rewarding flush in his cheeks. He closed his eyes and relaxed, sinking into the moment as he sunk into the inflatable as it let out a soft "squeeee!". Before he knew it, the tender embrace of sleep enveloped him and he dozed off.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Just something tranquil about the lazy spells of Saturday afternoons.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ End ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
