Even if one were to look up pictures of the extravagantly-decorated casino, or read stories of interactions with its bondage slaves and toys, one could not be prepared for the sheer magnitude of its magnificence.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The same could have been said of Wiki as he first stepped into the main lobby of the Silver Serpent. Just like the many lobbies of the casino, the main lobby's interior decor was changed frequently to the point of imprudent. Right now, it was themed like a chapel, complete with golden walls and angelic statues. Stained glass windows built into the walls were backlit with artificial sky panels that simulated realistic clouds, and a digitally-rendered sun shone through the glass dome on the ceiling of the room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragon chuckled nervously as he took it all in. Despite admiring the majestic welcome he was receiving, he could not help but feel a sense of absurdity at the irony of it all. A faceless rubber-suited drone took Wiki's luggage bag, escorting him to the front desk. The statues of angels were granite-encased furs with only their private parts exposed; their only reactions were muffled moans as guests ruthlessly teased them. It was as if this were a twisted parody of a church, an insult of depravity to the morals of religion.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Not that Wiki minded. After all, one did not go to the Silver Serpent to be holy. Rather, the opposite was true: they went here to indulge in all their vices from gambling at the casino's high-stakes tables to drunken guzzling of rare wines at its bars, from bondage slaves tending to you in the casino halls to sexual flings in the hotel rooms above.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The orange dragon, however, wasn't very adventurous. Despite being a wealthy and acclaimed owner of several large companies in various industries, he was generally shy and reserved, preferring the quiet of home rather than the racket of parties. Perhaps throughout the weekend that he was going to be here, he would try his hand at some casino games that he was familiar with and admire some of the bondage-clad guests and staff as they walked by.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>After all, despite everything he had heard about the Silver Serpent, he didn't come here expecting much. He was a hardworking dragon, and this would be a one-time visit to rest and relax, that's all this would be. Nothing more, nothing less.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>For some reason or another, Wiki once again found himself at the roulette tables of the Silver Serpent, watching as a white jade sphere the size of a bowling ball bounce across the spinning roulette wheel that was embedded in the floor, filling up the entire centre of the room. Surrounding the wheel were numerous roulette tables, all coordinating their rounds to the automated spinner in the middle.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The ball landed in the "28" slot.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki sighed. Another loss. With a croupier's rake, the dealer at the dragon's table swiped away the other chips from the table, leaving only those placed on the correct pockets. This was all for show, however, as the electronic transmitters built into the table added and deducted credits from the respective players' membership cards, updating the new values on the holographic displays in front of each player.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Then the tables were cleared for the next round. The central cone of the roulette wheel was raised into the air, allowing the jade ball to fall into the hidden mechanisms below before descending back into place. The huge wheel began spinning faster and faster, blending the numbers together in a blur of red, black, and the speck of green that was the "0" pocket. Even from his table, Wiki could feel the rush of wind from the rotation of the wheel.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a loud clatter, the jade ball was released from an opening at the side of the wheel, orbiting counter to the wheel's rotation. Some players around him began placing bets on the table with their chips. Others waited, staring at the wheel for flashes of divine inspiration that could perhaps lead to their windfall of winnings. Wiki was among them, staring at the wheel.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>More players were placing their bets. A few more seconds and the dealer would close the bet, but Wiki had not yet made up his mind. His hand reached for the pile of chips that were on the table in front of him, picking up three chips worth a hundred each. He was about to place them on the "5" pocket nearest to him when the number "19" came to mind instead.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Huh.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He slid the three chips over the "19" pocket on the table. Then he hesitated for a few seconds. His hand moved over to the remaining pile of chips on the table, easily worth a fortune in their respective denominations, sliding the whole stack over to the same pocket.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki felt the eyes of the other gamblers fall upon him and for a second, he began to regret his decision. A large bell hanging from the high ceiling of the room sounded with an unexpectedly gentle gong, and all the dealers at their respective tables echoed with "Bets closed."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>All that was left to do was wait.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki glanced nervously at the numeric display in front of him. The holographic screen computed the number of chips that he had placed on the table: from the lowest value of a hundred to the highest value of a hundred thousand. He had just placed a bet of $729,300 on a single number. If it were a low-risk bet like the odd or even pockets, he wouldn't have minded. But when it was just a single number, there was a 1-in-37 chance of winning $26,254,800. That left a 36-in-37 chance of all that money going down the drain.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragon hid his face in his palms as he resented his impulsiveness. What had come over him? Sure, he could pay off the amount: it wasn't like he didn't have billions of cash sitting in his personal bank account. But at the same time, he didn't get to where he was through reckless spending.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The jade ball was bouncing over the pocket dividers as it haphazardly chose a number to land on.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Clack.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Clack.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Clack.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Clack. The silence that followed meant that the ball had found its final resting spot.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki peeked out from behind his fingers. The white jade was obvious against the red and black of the wheel. The gaze of the other gamblers turned to him, some with incredulous expressions, others with suspicious glares. Even people from the other tables had turned to him, pointed by the electronic displays on the walls that singled him out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>That was how the Silver Serpent celebrated their gamblers' victories.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The jade ball had landed on "19".</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>This was his third visit to the Silver Serpent this year. There was a subtle feeling that Wiki couldn't quite explain, but the casino was beginning to feel more and more like home. Over the past few months, he had been gradually offloading his work over to his board members and subordinates, freeing up more and more of his time. This allowed him to set aside four days to take a first-class flight up, indulge in a long weekend of gambling and socializing with the friends he had made during the past view visits, then fly back home.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>After all, he wasn't going to be young forever. He might as well make the most of his youth while he still had it. And if he was honest with himself, the confidence that he was gaining from his success here was addictive. Wiki strode down the carpeted corridors until he reached the lounge that was his destination.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Stepping into the purple-lit lounge, Wiki immediately spotted his friends sitting in the corner: Teryx and Negadrake, fellow dragons with blue and black scales respectively. He had met up with them from time to time during his past visits after Teryx noticed the orange dragon's success at the games.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah, Wiki," Teryx called, lifting his wine glass as if to call him over, "We've been waiting for you." With his other hand, he waved at a rubber drone, saying "My friend here needs a footrest. And while you're at it, bring him a mojito."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki sat in the plush armchair and made himself comfortable. The drone came over with a drink in its hand, offering it to the orange dragon. Once he took it, the drone immediately got on its fours, crawling forward for Wiki's legs to rest on its back.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hey, wait. It's fine, I don't need a footrest," Wiki said flusteredly, but the drone didn't move from its position.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Let it be," Teryx waved his hand as he took another sip of wine, "Just enjoy yourself."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The orange dragon nodded in response, letting the weight of his feet rest on the firm support of the drone's squeaky, latex back.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Heard you've been making a name for yourself among the poker community," Negadrake nodded at Wiki, "Good job."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh?" Wiki was taken aback by the surprising compliment and he tried to hide his blush, "Well, I think the strategy is a bit like in business: figure out what the other party really has, then negotiate based on that."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Haha, it looks like we have a prodigy over here," Teryx chuckled, "I remember when I first found out I had a talent for poker myself. I could just </span><span class="italic">sense</span><span> what the cards were."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki took a sip from his glass, letting the sweet, minty taste spread over his tongue. The flavour was unexpectedly refreshing, and he found himself taking a bigger sip.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And Negadrake," Teryx turned to the black dragon, "There's some hearsay that you'll be getting your Master Gambler's title by your next visit or two, based on your progress."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Seriously?" Negadrake grinned enthusiastically.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mhm," the blue dragon nodded in response, "You hear things as an MG."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Heh, you should share the juicy news with us from time to time."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I already do," Teryx shrugged nonchalantly, "How about sharing your blackjack secrets, eh?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Haha, fine, fine. I'll show you guys the next time around," the black dragon chuckled, "How about you, Wiki?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'm still just here to have fun, haha," Wiki smiled nervously, feeling slightly out of place among the more experienced gamblers.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ah, perfectly fine," Teryx assured, "It's more of a side achievement for us, to be honest. We're all here to have some downtime away from life outside anyway."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You sure? I don't think I could ever get as good as you guys so if this is a problem—"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"It's not a problem at all. You're one of us now, and don't you forget it."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki brought the glass to his lips again and sipped more of the mojito, trying to hide a smile of happiness. Indeed, this place felt like home.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was no surprise that the orange dragon was here at the Silver Serpent to spend the new year holidays; Wiki felt that this place had been a good influence on him. Over the past year, he had gained newfound confidence in himself. Revealed a dominant attitude hidden beneath his years of quiet and reserved demeanour. Wiki chuckled; the irony of learning virtues in a place like the Silver Serpent was not lost on him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a smug grin, he threw his cards down on the poker table: a full house. There were audible groans from the rest of the gamblers as their credits were deducted from their membership cards and credited to Wiki's. That was enough victories for the day. He grabbed his card and got off his chair, making his way towards the exit.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>An eagle drone was standing by the hand doorway, clad from head to toe in a full rubber suit and a gas mask. Wiki waved his hand at it coolly with the instruction, "To my room."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Minutes later, both Wiki and the nameless, rubberized drone were in the former's room; the dragon was lying in bed, sporting a throbbing erection as the avian serviced him. The drone's latex form was sleek and featureless: the black suit hugging tightly to every curve of its muscular body, an ample bulge sealed away its cock, and a smooth, featureless gas mask with dark, tinted lenses over the eyes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The gas mask made sure that the drone had no way of taking Wiki's member in its mouth, making it practically useless, just as its cock was. Its only redeeming factor as a sex toy was its tight, rubber tailhole that was meant to be abused by the Silver Serpent's guests. That was precisely what it was doing as it worked its thighs and hips, riding the dragon's mast as it clenched its tense fuckhole.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki's wings were spread out behind him against the soft, cotton sheets and his tail was fondling the drone's rubber tail feathers. His hands were rubbing up and down the eagle's smooth body, feeling the slippery, shiny rubber glide beneath his scaly fingers. </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"F-fuck," the dragon gasped in pleasure, letting his raw, sexual instinct take over as he humped the heck out of the rubber drone whose sole existence was for this. The eagle, on the other hand, showed no emotions. Like all good drones, it had no use for such things. Its only purpose was to serve and give pleasure. The only hint of humanity it had was its breathless panting that came out like hisses through the gas mask, filling the air with a smell of rubber and the constant sound of "Hssss" as its rubber rump rose and descended on Wiki's hips.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Just the way the orange dragon liked it. He could feel himself pushed closer and closer to the edge. His arousal was approaching its peak. Just then, Wiki could have sworn he caught a glimpse of the eagle's eyes through the dark lenses of its gas mask. A look of pure, satisfied bliss, as if the world was simple and nothing else mattered apart from its purpose as a sex toy. As if it had achieved some form of submissive Nirvana.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But his need for release trumped his philosophical contemplations. With a loud moan, Wiki spilt his copious seed into the drone's cum receptacle. The drone continued riding him, gradually slowing down until it rested on the dragon's crotch, hilting the rod deep within his rubber hole.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As Wiki caught his breath, a sense of tired satisfaction washed over him and he closed his eyes. The rubber drone got up and curled up beside him, keeping the dragon company on the bed as it kept his cum warm within its insides.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It felt like hours later when Wiki woke up, feeling refreshed and contented. Picking up the rubber plug that came with the drone, he shoved it into the resting eagle's tailhole and pressed the button at its base. The plug inflated, tightening against its tense pucker and keeping the draconic cum trapped inside for safekeeping. There was a muffled whimper from the drone, but it got off the bed obediently with Wiki, standing at attention and awaiting further instructions.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You can go now," the dragon waved the drone away, giving its ample rump a squeeze before sending it out the door. But before the drone closed the door behind it, the imagery of the drone's bliss flashed in Wiki's mind. That level of peacefulness and zen was immensely intriguing and the dragon had to know more. "Wait!" he called for the drone. The rubber eagle turned around to face him, standing at attention in the hotel corridor.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was a moment of silence as Wiki formulated the words in his head.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Take me to where the drones are made."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The rest of the Silver Serpent seemed like a pauper's house in comparison to the lounge of the Silver Serpent's CEO. The lounge was the size of a ballroom and a richly-decorated carpet covered its floor from corner to corner. Its walls sported intricate designs of winding snakes, twisting together in mesmerizing tessellations, interrupted only by marble pillars with golden trim along its edges.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>In the middle of the room was a huge circle of grass, and in its middle stood what appeared to be a tall tree, except that its entirety was made out of transparent, shiny crystal. The dragon would've passed it off for a crystal sculpture if not for the fact that the branches and leaves were swaying slightly with the moving air, accompanied by the occasional falling leaf.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Eight waist-high pillars surrounded the tree, acting as fountains as they poured clear water towards the middle where a channel collected the water around the tree. A giant, spherical light hanging from the ceiling acted as the tree's artificial sun.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The eagle drone had directed Wiki to a secretary, who then brought him to this room, giving the dragon a few long moments to take in the entire aura of the room.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Wow..." he muttered under his breath. In all his time as a renowned businessman, he had never seen anything so stupidly extravagant as this.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Impressive, isn't it?" the secretary chuckled, "I'll switch the displays so you can view the dronification process that goes on in our labs before Mr Castor is free to meet you."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragon opened his mouth to inquire about the displays when suddenly, the walls seemed to turn into windows. What Wiki assumed was wallpaper were actually display panels built into the walls. The dragon walked up to one of them and looked at it. To his surprise, instead of watching a flat display, the display was three-dimensional, allowing him a top-down view of the dronification labs, almost as if he were watching the rooms from a viewing gallery above it all.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"How does this—" Wiki began as he turned to face the secretary, only to find that she had already left the room, leaving him here alone. He turned back to the display panels below and watched the dronification process happen below him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>In one of the rooms, he could see a lizard struggling as he was dragged to an oval-shaped pod, bound inside with metal clamps. Then a futuristic helmet descended over his head, and before long the lizard stopped squirming. Then liquid latex began to fill the pod.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>In another room, a lioness bound to a metal rack was slowly hypnotized through headphones bound to her head. Her eyes were glazed and her mouth was mumbling something Wiki could not hear.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Each conversion was unique, depending on the subject's dispositions as well as the personal preferences of the staff that was in charge of processing said subject.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hello, you must be Wiki," a smooth voice called out behind him. The dragon turned around to see an arctic wolf approaching him with confident but unhurried strides. The wolf was wearing a clean, white business suit that appeared to be tailor-made, enhancing the curves of his athletic form. A black silk tie with snake motifs hung from his neck, completing his sleek look.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mr Castor?" Wiki responded uncertainly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Please, call me Decro," replied the wolf, "And have a seat." Decro pointed towards two leather armchairs on the grass patch with a short glass coffee table between them. A bottle of wine sat on the table beside two wine glasses, waiting for them.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragon complied nervously. He was gripped with a sudden feeling that he should not be here. But then again, why not? He had questions. Questions that he didn't know the words to but he wanted answers to all the same. All to satisfy the deep hunger and curiosity that was inside of him. He sat down in an armchair and the wolf joined him on the other.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The room's walls faded away, turning into a blue sky with clouds gently sailing across the ceiling, framing the artificial sun with their soft borders. The air conditioning began blowing in a cool breeze, creating a rustling in the tree as its leaves brushed against each other.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So, I'm told you have questions about my drones," Decro commented as he gently uncorked the wine bottle with a gentle pop before pouring it into the glasses. Wiki's eyes widened as he read the bottle's label: Vol de L'aigle 1849. Then he brought the wine to his lips and gave it a sip. A sweet, tart taste spread across his tongue. It had a rich flavour, not too heavy, not too light. His mind began to swim, more from the dizziness of tasting such fine wine than from the alcohol itself. But he had to focus.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Yeah, I...I'm curious about them, actually," he paused, hoping for Decro to fill in the rest of the words for him. The wolf, however, merely held the stem of the wine glass, gently swirling the wine in it as he watched the dragon with inquisitive eyes. Wiki would have to come up with the words himself.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What makes them...what they are?" Wiki blushed as he tried to formulate his question, "I mean, most of the drones you find in the market are either rubber-suited furs for rent who act out the role, or entirely-brainwashed slaves who are too mindless to do anything apart from following instructions. But what you have here...drones who...like..."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Drones who dedicate their lives to their masters," Decro finished for him, "Drones who are consumed by their sole purpose in life. Their mission, their ambition to serve."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It wasn't a question, but Wiki nodded anyway. Almost like the wolf had taken the words right out of the swarm of thoughts in his mind.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Over here at the Silver Serpent," Decro continued, "I personally like to think that we give people a new chance at life. If a gambler finds his success here at our games, then we celebrate it. If he finds his ruin here, we take that and turn it into something new. We turn </span><span class="italic">them</span><span> into something new."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki shifted in his seat. The calm manner in which the owner of the Silver Serpent talked about turning unwilling debtors into mere objects was slightly unnerving, but he could not help but feel a sense of respect for the wolf's confidence and charisma. Confidence and charisma that he himself desired.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The Silver Serpent will bring about a new paradigm in thinking. It's more than just a casino: it's a lifestyle. A way of seeing the world in success and failure. If you are skilled, if you are powerful, if you are worthy, then should you not enjoy the fruits of this world? And if you are worthless, pathetic, unusable, then it's time we give them a new lease on life.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Drones are like that. We empty them out. We throw out their past lives. And then we fill them with purpose anew. Give them a meaning, a part of this new world order. That is why our drones act the way they do."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragon's heart was beating loudly in his chest. He had no idea why he was feeling this way, filled a strange mixture of nervousness and excitement.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Where do I stand?" he asked apprehensively. He might not like the answer, but he had to know.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You?" Decro chuckled, "Need you even ask?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf let the tension hang in the air before continuing, "You're wealthy. Owner of five major corporations. Superpowers in their own industries. Anything you want, you have the money, the power, the authority to seize it. And now, you're finding your true voice. A voice of confidence, courage, and determination. A voice that had led you here, to me.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You are worthy."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki let out a sigh of relief, only just realizing he had been holding his breath the entire time.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"But...you can be better."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Better? How?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I can show you things beyond what mere capitalism can give you," Decro declared, "Powers that only the mad and the mighty can only come close to conceiving." A dark aura began to swirl around the wolf, darkening the area around him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki hastily got off his seat. He wanted to take a step back but his feet were planted firmly on the ground as if they had taken root into the rich soil beneath him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You will know what it is like to command. Command the masses the way I command them. Men will bend to your will. They will bow before your feet. They will obey your every order."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Black tendrils rose out of the ground around Wiki, curling around his feet and feeling about his ankles. But they didn't advance beyond that. It was as if they were waiting for instructions. A sign to proceed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I will give you a new purpose."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki's eyes met Decro's. That last statement was not just a statement. It was a question. An offer. An invitation. One that he would be stupid to refuse. Throwing aside his reservations, the dragon nodded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Almost immediately, the tendrils on the ground rose up to grab Wiki and a brief moment of panic flooded his mind. His ankles and wrists were gripped tightly and spread apart until he was spreadeagled in the air. His wings were pulled wide open and his tail was secured to the ground.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was as if a flash of lucidity gripped his mind and he began to wonder why he was even here in the first place. Why was he here with the owner of the Silver Serpent in his office? How did he end up as the casino's regular? What was he here for?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But then the answers came as naturally. He had been tired of his past life. A life of nothing but playing corporate games and office politics. And perhaps subconsciously, he had been searching for something more.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, now here it is," Decro spoke, as if in response to his thoughts. More tendrils snaked their way out of the wolf's back, advancing towards the dragon. They began ripping his clothes off, shredding them until they were nothing more than scraps on the ground and leaving him naked in the cool garden.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro stepped closer and closer until their chests were almost touching. His hand rose to stroke the underside of Wiki's chin with a firm motion as the dragon watched, transfixed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Your splendid body will be given a purpose beyond what you've ever experienced before."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Two of Decro's back tendrils reached for the dragon, one of them caressing the underside of his cock, the other pushing against his tailhole. Then they began stroking his dick and fucking his hole simultaneously.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hnggft!" Wiki let out a loud gasp, slowly thrusting his hips in the air in response. The tendril up his insides was thrusting in and out, nudging against his prostate with each plunge. His member tensed up in time with the thrusts as his arousal grew. Decro placed his palm firmly on the dragon's chest, feeling his sculpted pectorals as he stroked down.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Time seemed to slow for the dragon as he lost himself in the intense arousal he was feeling. His tight pucker was worked over with the friction of the tendrils and his eager cock was stimulated with intense pumps.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He threw his head back and opened his mouth as he panted vehemently. His arms, legs, wings, and tail were tugging back against the tendrils that bound him, but more from the waves of carnal bliss that shot through his body than from any intention to escape.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Then out of the corner of his vision, Wiki noticed a dark latex spreading over his arm. His eyes opened in surprise and he watched the liquid spread over his scales, sticking to it like a living creature attempting to consume his body. He looked down to see his legs being subjected to the same process. Amidst the arousal, he felt no fear. If anything, this felt natural, as if this was what he had wanted all along.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The latex began spreading up Wiki's back, coating his wings and tail. The thick liquid began to smooth out over the curves of his body as if they were merging with his scales. His chest felt like it was tightening as his pecs began to expand. His abs puffed up, forming well-defined curves on his midriff. The muscles on his arms and legs swelled up, filling him with a sense of immense strength.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hfft!" the dragon huffed as the toughening of his body was combined with the arousal that was still rising within him. The rocking of his hips felt more and more powerful as the muscles in his body worked themselves into a frenzy. Decro's dark aura swirled around both of them, caressing their bodies with fervent strokes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>At the same time, the latex began to seep over Wiki's head, concealing his face and blocking his vision. His face began to elongate and sharpen beneath the rubber and his horns grew out longer, twisting sharply behind him. Pointed spikes began to appear on his wings and at the tip of his tail.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His new, dark eyes opened and he looked down at his body. His features had been sharpened and the muscles in his body had been enhanced. His cock looked draconic now, ribbed and tapered as the tendrils worked him over.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a loud moan, he shot his load into the air, splattering his dark purple body with his seed. The feeling of ecstasy filled Wiki's body as he tried to catch his breath. The tendrils lowered him to the ground, letting him stand on his powerful feet. He flexed his arms in turn and swiped his tail, feeling the raw strength and adrenaline rush through him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He was at a loss for words. But words were not needed as he gazed back at Decro. The wolf silently smirked back at him. An expression of satisfaction and pride in his new creation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki was a new creation.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ To be continued ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
