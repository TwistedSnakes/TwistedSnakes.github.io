He spots a grygon by the name of Charrtar, and challenges his sexual dominance. This leads them to have sex on a lounge couch with Charrtar fucking Wiki. However, Wiki took on his demonic form, and when Charrtar orgasms, he pulls the grygon in for a kiss, and begins coating him with latex. The latex forms a latex suit with a gas mask, which begins sedating Charrtar with a brainwashing gas, turning the grygon into a submissive drone.\nAfter the encounter, Wiki feels the hunger within him growing. He confronts Decro about it. Decro turns into his demonic form and uses his tentacles to suspend and restrain Wiki. He then fucks Wiki from behind, before climaxing into him. He then uses his cock to pump his eggs deep into Wiki, giving him a stomach bulge. Wiki then orgasms too, and, with the wolf's knot tying them together, they both rest on Decro's throne.", "prefix_text": "This story is made up of two parts<br>\u2022 <a href=\"../s-59a/read.html\">Part 1: A Deal with the Devil</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"../s-59b1/read.html\">Part 2: A Deal with the Devil - Soul Vore Version</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"../s-59b2/read.html\">Part 2: A Deal with the Devil - Hard Soul Vore Version</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"../s-59b3/read.html\">Part 2: A Deal with the Devil - Merging Version</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"../s-59b4/read.html\">Part 2: A Deal with the Devil - Digital TF and Brainwash Version</a><br>\u2022 Part 2: A Deal with the Devil - Oviposition Version (You are here)<br>", "commissioners": ["Wikiwarrior"], "authors": ["TwistedSnakes"], "illustrators": ["DragonTears"], "tags": ["anal penetration", "anal sex", "character - Decro (TwistedSnakes)", "character - Wiki (Wikiwarrior)", "consent", "corruption", "demon", "dominant", "dominant/submissive", "drone", "dronification", "gay", "goo", "identity loss", "knot tying", "knotting", "latex", "living suit", "male", "male/male", "orgasm", "oviposition", "setting - Silver Serpent", "species - dragon", "species - grygon", "species - gryphon", "species - hybrid", "submissive", "tentacles", "transformation"], "display_tags": ["Anal sex", "Anal sex", "Bottom - Male dragon", "Consent", "Consent", "Dominant/Submissive", "Dronification", "Hypnosis, identity loss", "Knotting and tying", "Male/Male", "Oviposition", "Tentacles", "Top - Male wolf"], "data": {}, "is_listed": true};

Sure, his regular form didn't come with the awesome strength that his demonic form provided, but there's just something that people find unapproachable about a well-built demonic dragon walking through the hallways of the Silver Serpent. And if he were to do his job well, he'd need to make use of his draconic charisma.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>This, however, didn't mean that he was deprived of his new powers. Instead, he could still use his enhanced senses to assist his search. He could perceive the nature of people's hearts as a faint aura swirling around their bodies, visible if only he looked a little closer.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He had first discovered this power when Decro had transformed him. At first, he thought the Decro's aura was still hanging in the air as the wolf showed him around the Silver Serpent: a bold but dangerous move. Only upon closer inspection, did he realize that the aura was merely in his own perception and not something that was visible in real life.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>After that, he started noticing similar auras around the guests and patrons of the casino. Some of them were pale and white. Hues of purity mixed in with light splashes of yellow or blue, depending on how untainted the person was. Most of them, however, had dark vapours creeping in on the edges as the casino's deprave scenes began to sully their purity. Others had darker auras. Purple and black mixed in with hints of red and green. They were not as dark as Decro's aura, but it was a good sign: the corruption was taking hold.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Now, in his orange form, his eyes scanned the grandiose room like a predator looking for his prey. If one didn't know what he was up to, they'd assume he was merely another guest looking for another handsome visitor to ravish that night.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His eyes fell upon a hybrid: a beautiful mix of gryphon and dragon. The grygon had the body of an anthro gryphon, feathers, claws and all, but his head and wings sported sharp, draconic features such as horns and scales. But what piqued Wiki's interest was the deep, dark aura that stood out, even amidst the grygon's dusky blue feathers.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragon could feel a sense of anticipation rise within him as his heart began to beat faster and his body began to feel restless. This person was ripe for the picking. And he'd have the pleasure of reaping the poor soul.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He made his way over to the grygon who was sitting at a blackjack table, glancing at his cards: two nines. Eighteen. When it came to the grygon's turn, he was about to stand when Wiki stepped in beside him and said, "Hit."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dealer turned to Wiki and the grygon as he waited for a response. The hybrid turned to him too and asked, "What's the meaning of this?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Trust me," Wiki smirked, "Hit."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"And if I lose?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Then I'll pay you twice what you lose here," the dragon slid his Silver Serpent card on the table into the card scanner's range. The dealer nodded in response, entering Wiki's suggestion into the panel in front of him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The grygon gave him a dirty look before turning back to the table with a huff. "Hit," he said, and the electronic card dealer on the table slid a card towards him. He picked up the card and flipped it over. A three of hearts, coming to a total of twenty-one. Blackjack.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He scoffed incredulously and then turned to the orange dragon as if asking for an explanation.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The name's Wiki," the dragon grinned, offering his clawed hand for a handshake. The hybrid took it with a firm grip and shook. "Charrtar," he introduced curtly, "So what do you want?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You seem interesting," Wiki mused out loud, "And I think I'd like to know you more." He tilted his chin up, pointing upwards as if towards his hotel room in the floors above them.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Heh," Charrtar sneered, "I'm not a sub, you know. Just because you were lucky with your guesses doesn't mean I'm about to serve your cock. I'm a dom through and through, so you'll be begging for more of my dick by the time I'm done with you."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fine with me," the dragon smirked back, "But I'm pretty sure you'll be the one begging for more."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Not going to happen, kid, but I like your spunk," Charrtar reached for Wiki's crotch and squeezed the bulge that had formed in the dragon's pants, "And we'll do it in the lounge next door."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The couches of the lounge turned out to be surprisingly comfortable for sex as Charrtar joined Wiki on the spacious velvet sofa. The dragon was lying on his back, still wearing his business suit with his hands running over Charrtar's chest. The grygon was nuzzling back, brushing his muzzle against the side of the dragon's neck and eliciting soft moans from him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki's hands found the hybrid's shirt buttons and he began undoing them, revealing his soft, feathery chest. The grygon did the same, stripping the dragon down as he stroked down Wiki's scaly chest with his tongue. Their shirts came off and were flung onto the floor, giving them full access to each other's upper bodies.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Their bulges rubbed against each other as Charrtar nibbled the edge of Wiki's ear and the dragon squeezed the hybrid's nipples in response. "F-fuck," Wiki gasped as Charrtar explored the erogenous zones of the dragon's auricle with the tip of his tongue. Spasms of arousal shot down his spine, making him squirm beneath the hybrid's body which was pinning him down.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Moving on to Wiki's other ear, the grygon slipped his hand down to the dragon's crotch, cupping his palm and feeling the firm, rounded bulge beneath the cashmere fabric of his pants. He gave the bulge a light squeeze and a small tug, making Wiki moan one more time before he began undoing his belt and pants. Both their pants came off, leaving Wiki and Charrtar in their underwear. The dragon was mesmerized for a second as he stared at the outline of the grygon's sizable member on his underwear.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Not for long, though, as Charrtar resumed grinding his bulge against Wiki's. Their pleasured huffs filled the lounge as Wiki leaked his pre into the cotton fabric. His rump clenched instinctively as if eager for the cock that would soon be entering. He nuzzled back against the side of Charrtar's maw, feeling the soft feathers against his smooth scales.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The firm shaft of the grygon rubbing against his crotch told him what he needed to know about the hybrid's size: it was great and girthy. And Wiki craved that inside of him. His hands glided down the Charrtar's obliques and hips, and he began slowly pulling down the grygon's underwear. The top of the underwear slipped down, revealing the thick base of the grygon's shaft. Then the engorged knot followed, then the shaft. And finally, the glorious, tapered tip of the grygon's cock was showing as the entirety of it stood erect in front of Wiki.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki licked his lips, slipping off his underwear and unveiling his own member to Charrtar. His hands grabbed the armrest that was over his head and he raised his legs, offering his tight pucker to the grygon. "It's time to deliver on your promise," he challenged, "Make me beg."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh, you will," the grygon puffed out his chest and sneered. His hand gripped the head of his dick, milking the liberal amount of pre from his cock and smearing it over his entire length as a natural lubricant.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Taking the residual amount, he stuck his fingers against Wiki's tailhole, gently shoving in to coat the entrance and insides with the slick liquid. With a firm and controlled motion, he began thrusting in and pulling out his fingers, fucking Wiki with his digits. The orange dragon began groaning in pleasure, feeling the grygon's sturdy fingers invading his insides as he tensed his quivering pucker against them. "F-fuck!" he gasped as his erect cock throbbed in a fervent announcement of his hunger for more.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Then the grygon pulled out his fingers, giving them a lick to taste Wiki's ample rear and smell his musk. "Your fuckhole tastes pretty good, boy," Charrtar declared, "Good enough to ravage with my cock."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki's moans were his response, one that the grygon was more than happy to accept. His hefty cock was soon nudged against the dragon's loosened tailhole, letting the orange dragon feel just how big the grygon was.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ready for it?" Charrtar challenged, "It's not too late to change your mind."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Give it to me," Wiki insisted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Heh, take a deep breath then," the grygon instructed before plunging his length right into the dragon's tight flesh.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Son of a bitch!" Wiki yelled as he felt the firm shaft against his inner walls as he clenched back. There was a painful tightness in his rump as the phallus within him filled him up as no cock had ever done before. The grygon remained hilted within the dragon, letting him get used to the size of his member.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>After the dragon's breaths had calmed down, Charrtar gently pulled out, giving the dragon a brief moment of relief before he shoved his massive cock back in. Wiki yelped in pain and pleasure as his legs wrapped around the grygon's waist. Charrtar began thrusting in and out of Wiki's tailhole, pounding his firm and supple ass like how a fuck toy is meant to be abused.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragon humped back in response, rocking his hips in time with the hybrid's plunges. Their moans were so loud, it was a wonder nobody from outside heard them and came to have a look. Wiki watched the grygon's expression of pleasure: his eyes were closed and his mouth was gaping open with his tongue lolling out.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki could tell that the hybrid was close to climaxing. He would, too, given his arousal, but he had something better in mind. He focused deep inside him as if drawing out his inner power. Sure enough, his muscles began to bulge out as his scales took on a latex sheen. His horns and features sharpened and soon his body was back to its demonic form. The latex from his body began to spread to Charrtar's body, spreading up his cock and to his hips.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft!" the grygon panted. He had not yet noticed the rubber that was slowly transforming his body as his mind was consumed by the imminent climax. Sure enough, he shot his warm load into Wiki's latex tailhole.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What the fu—" the grygon opened his eyes and noticed what was going on, but it was too late. The latex had consumed his lower body and wings, and his chest was next. Charrtar backed off in fear but Wiki wasn't about to let him go. He grabbed the back of the grygon's head and pulled him in, forcing him into a kiss. Their lips touched and the dragon kissed hard.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-center"><img src="img-0.png" class="image"></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mfft!" Charrtar yelped in terror as the latex from the dragon's lips spread to his. It crept up his face, slowly encasing his entire head in rubber. The latex over the grygon's body shifted, slowly warping his form to exhibit sculpted, muscular features. The rubber around his lips turned into the valve of a gas mask, and the rest of his face followed. The squirming grygon's eyes were soon covered by dark, emotionless lenses on his face.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Then a dark vapour began to enter his gas mask: a light sedative mixed with a chemical concoction that would soon brainwash its inhaler. Sure enough, Charrtar's shoulders drooped and his hands fell to his side. A glazed look washed over his eyes as he remained knelt in front of Wiki.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragon stroked the back of the grygon's rubber-encased head, caressing the smooth surface. "You look hungry. Hungry for my cock inside your rubber fuckhole." Wiki's cock throbbed in response to his own suggestion. The drone nodded back in a daze. "Then I want you to beg for it." Without hesitation, the drone put its hands together in a begging position, whimpering for the dragon's cock.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Charrtar was no more. In his place was an obedient drone who would listen to Wiki's each and every command. </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Look who's begging for more now?"</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was a pang of hunger. Hunger that started out with a small craving. Hunger that grew each time he devoured another soul. Hunger that had turned into a ravenous appetite within six months since he had received this power.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki had amassed a small army of subservient drones. Drones that would serve him and the Silver Serpent. But each corrupted soul he reaped would only satiate his hunger for a small moment before coming back more tenacious than ever.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>That feeling of hunger left him feeling a profound sense of emptiness within his chest. A desolate void that seemed to consume his very soul. And no amount of exquisite food or lavish wine could gratify the acute need.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But he would content himself for now by consuming the souls of the corrupted. He'll clear their minds so that they would be uninhibited to obey his instructions. He'll remove their wills and replace them with his own.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>They would serve him with their lives. And he would be their king.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro was calmly sitting on a grand throne made out of black marble when the demonic dragon burst into the dimly-lit room. His muscular form had no need for clothes as he made his way between the rows of tall pillars, striding swiftly to the foot of the steps which led up to the raised throne.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Master!" he called, looking up at the wolf.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What have you called upon me for?" Decro responded.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You...you gave me this hunger, didn't you?" Wiki panted heavily, "This craving...for more!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I did no such th—"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Then explain to me, why do I feel this craving? This emptiness inside?" the dragon retorted.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"That's the nature of your mortal form," Decro explained composedly, "Once you get a taste of my power, you unwittingly desire more. You feel starved because of an appetite your earthly body forced upon you."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Take it! Take it away from me!" Wiki demanded, his voice turning into a vicious growl.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro smirked, apparently immensely pleased with himself.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What," the dragon snapped angrily, "Are you not going to help me? Do you think this is a joke?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Oh, on the contrary, servant," the wolf scoffed. "All this while, I've known that you'd come to feel this burning urge. I've only been waiting for you to ask. Come up here," he instructed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki walked up the steps until he was face to face with Decro. The wolf stood up, observing the dragon's dark, latex scales and razor-sharp horns. Features that Wiki could have sworn grew sharper and more angular over time. The wolf's clawed hand raised a finger to stroke the underside of the dragon's jaw, sliding down his neck to his jugular notch.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"My faithful servant," the wolf whispered softly, "If it's hunger you feel, then it's hunger I'll satisfy." A tingle shot down Wiki's spine as he stood still. Dark aura burst out around Decro, swirling around their feet as black tendrils rose out of the onyx floor. The mist swirled around the wolf for a few seconds before dissipating, leaving him standing on the cool stone floor in the nude and Wiki's eyes could not help but stare at the girthy shaft before him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Turn around," Decro commanded and Wiki complied instinctively. He stood still, watching the entrance of the large hall when suddenly, the wolf's tendrils grabbed him by the wrists, yanking him up so that he was suspended by his arms. Wiki yelped in surprise but he curbed his protests as he felt Decro's arms began caressing his waist.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The tendrils steadily lowered the dragon down until his pucker was positioned on top of Decro's cock. And then the tendrils let him down, plunging the wolf's shaft deep into his tailhole.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"D-damn," Wiki gasped as the entirety of the wolf's member filled him up inside. It was thick and warm, spreading his tight tunnel as his pucker sat at the top of the wolf's globose knot. More tendrils wrapped around his waist and he was lifted up once more.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Then the tendrils let him back down, allowing the massive dick to tear through him again. Wiki could feel his cock twitch and his pucker tense up from the arousal.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hmpfft!" he yelped in pleasure as he rocked his hips in time with the tendrils. The wolf was holding Wiki's latex body tightly, pounding his fuckhole relentlessly. The friction in his ass was getting insanely gratifying, working his libido up to its peak.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf, too, was experiencing euphoria as he fucked the latex hole of the dragon. Wiki's tense sphincter was firmly gripping the shaft of his flesh sceptre, pumping it ferociously. The rising and falling motion was repeated again and again, until...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro sunk his knot into Wiki as he climaxed, shooting his warm load inside the dragon. Wiki, however, had not yet peaked. He continued humping, using his internal walls to milk the wolf's dripping cock. Suddenly, he whimpered as something round was pushed past his pucker and into his insides. The round object shot up into him, bumping against his prostate and eliciting another whine of arousal.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What are you—" Wiki began, but the wolf thrust once more, pumping another spherical object deep into him.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You desired to be filled, did you not?" Decro asked confidently, "You shall be a vessel for my eggs."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Wiki's eyes widened in fear as he squirmed. Another egg was pumped deep into him and his anal cavity began to feel increasingly packed. "F-fuck," he gasped. His insides were getting stretched with each additional egg, but the wolf was not stopping. How many eggs had been pumped into him now? Ten? Twenty?
