Has livestreaming gone too far? Decro finds himself on the receiving end of a audience-hungry fox, and himself boxed in on all sides. Literally.", "summary": "Kuro invites Decro onto his gaming livestream as a celebration of reaching his subscriber count milestone. Decro is made to strip down to his tight trunks and get into a box in front of an audience of thousands. However, to his surprise and shock, he's muzzled with a tube gag and the lid of the box is latched, turning him into a cube. He's kept hydrated with the tube while he's stuck in sensory deprivation.\nHe's kept in there for twenty-four hours, but after that, Kuro coerces him to get into smaller and smaller boxes, staying for increasing durations of time. His cock is secured in a tube to clear his liquid waste, and a gas mask with a tube gag replaces the muzzle. Two vibrators, one strapped onto his cock and one plugged in his tailhole, are controlled by the stream's donators to tease him.\nWhen Decro is forced into the smallest box several months later, the box is so small that the walls of the box have to be tightened around him. He's forced to endure the pain as his body is compressed. His mouth and tailhole lead to holes on opposite side of the cube, and his cock is left sticking out one side, glued in a rubber sheath. Draco and Kyngios, two big donors to Kuro's stream, are invited to fuck the cube's holes, spit-roasting the wolf inside. All the while, Kuro teases the captive's latex cock, occasionally denying him his orgasm. Only when the tops have climaxed into Decro's holes is he allowed to cum himself. Fang, the biggest donor then receives the cube, with Decro in it, as a reward. He plugs both of the cube's holes, encases the rubber cock in a null bulge, before taking the fucktoy home.", "commissioners": [], "authors": ["TwistedSnakes"], "illustrators": [], "tags": ["adhesive", "anal penetration", "anal plug", "bad end", "bottom", "character - Decro (TwistedSnakes)", "character - Draco (KILLERDR4G0N)", "character - Fang (Shironranshiin)", "character - Kuro (Alonlan_Yuki)", "character - Kyngios (Kyngios)", "cum slave", "cum swallowing", "encasement", "gag", "gay", "glory hole", "latex", "male", "male/male", "multiple penetrations", "muzzle", "non-consent", "objectification", "orgasm denial", "permanent", "public play", "restraints", "sensory deprivation", "spit-roast", "stimulation", "top", "top/bottom", "tube gag", "vibrator", "victim", "villain", "villain/victim"], "display_tags": ["Male/Male", "Male x3/Male", "Villain - Male fox", "Victim - Male wolf", "Top - Male sergal", "Top - Male wolf", "Top - Male dragon", "Public play", "Muzzle with tube gag", "Anal plug", "Cock and anal vibrators", "Trapped in a box", "Latex encasement", "Objectification", "Glory hole", "Spit-roast", "Orgasm denial", "Cum slave", "Non-consent", "Permanent", "Bad end"], "data": {}, "is_listed": true};

    <div id="story-form"><div class="story-container"><div class="story"><p class="title align-left">Streamer's Box</p><p class="subtitle align-left">Written by TwistedSnakes</p><div class="title-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hey, what's up gamers?" a fox greeted cheerily as he appeared on the livestream, "KuroGame here once again. Can you guys hear me?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He reached over the desk and adjusted the camera and microphone as he looked at the stream on his computer monitor. "Alright, everything's working fine," he grinned, leaning back again, "So, since we've reached the hundred-K subscriber goal, I've got a very special guest here to join us for our twenty-four-hour livestream. Decro, come join me on camera."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A white wolf joined Kuro on the stream, waving hello to the unseen audiences that watched through the webcam mounted on the leftmost of the fox's three monitors.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So guys, this is Decro. He's one of the friends in my IRL clique, and we hang out quite often. So," Kuro turned to the wolf, "Here's the challenge for this stream: you are to strip down to your underwear and try to fit into this box." Kuro rolled his chair to the side to allow the camera to catch the sight of a black cube that sat on a sturdy table. If the cube were on the floor, it would've been waist-high, but its position on the table made it seem taller on the stream.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kuro unfastened two latches on either side of the cube, and the entire front side of the cube came away in his hands. "Well Decro, think you can fit into this box?" he challenged.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Pfft, that box is big enough for me."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Haha, spoken like a true challenger. Well, now's your chance to prove yourself. Take off your clothes, if you don't mind."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro shrugged nonchalantly, trying to hide a subtle blush that had spread across his cheeks as he took off his shirt.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So some of you astute viewers might have recognized Decro already, but for those who don't, he's one of the lead underwear models for Leo Lux. And as you can tell by his sculpted body," Kuro waved his hand over Decro's torso, as if showing off a product line, "He deserves his position."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf had stripped down to his tight compression trunks, looking at the camera sheepishly. The light of the room faintly accentuated the curves of his butt and bulge, the latter of which Kuro proceeded to give a soft grope.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"H-hey!" Decro protested, "Isn't this a kid-friendly stream?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Or is it?" the fox teased, giving the bulge a soft rub as he felt the wolf's cock respond in turn with a moment of involuntary i tensing up. "Now, get into the box, butt-first," Kuro instructed, before teasing, "That is if you can even fit."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hmpft, you'll see," the wolf scoffed. Standing in front of the box's opening and facing the camera, he leaned forward and sat on the edge of the box before sliding his rump into it. The box was lightly padded, making it not too uncomfortable as Decro filled the space in the box. He had to lean forward slightly as he shifted inwards, but sure enough, he could get himself into the box. He was now hunched over with his hands between his legs and his knees bent.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He looked out of the cube at the fox. "Well, I'm in," he grinned, "Guess I win that challenge."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"It doesn't count until the lid is on," Kuro retorted playfully.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Fine," Decro rolled his eyes. Before he could react, however, he found the box tipping backwards. Kuro had pushed it over so that the wolf was now stuck in the box, lying on his back.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What the–yip!" he yelped in surprise as a muzzle was quickly pushed over his snout, preventing him from further speaking. A tube in the muzzle slid into his open mouth as the straps were buckled over his head. The shock allowed Kuro to thread the tube through a hole in the lid and positioned it over the box.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was the sound of muffled yelps and panicked knocks coming from the box as Kuro latched the lid in place. "Hush, and listen to me," the fox commanded and the cube went silent.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"If you need something to drink, just give a shout. Otherwise, I don't expect to hear anything from you for the next twenty-four hours. If you understand, make some noise." There was the sound of a defeated whimper as Decro came to terms with his predicament.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The fox patted the box before turning back to the screen and sitting in his chair. "Alright gamers, we'll check back on our underwear model after our stream is over. Now, back to our schedule of games."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro had no idea how long he had been stuck in the darkness of the box. After the first few minutes of fruitless protests, he calmed down and accepted his cramped position. He had to grunt a few times whenever he got thirsty, which would be reciprocated with a short stream of water. Otherwise, his cubic imprisonment had been relatively uneventful.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Hours went by as he listened to Kuro's gameplay commentary, with the occasional knocks on his box's walls as the fox made sure that he was still alive in the cube. He must've drifted in and out of sleep a few times, but it was hard for him to tell when the entirety of his vision is pitch black.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Twenty-four hours must've passed because the wolf was rudely awakened by the tipping of the box. The side of the box hit the table and the wolf's inertia threw him out of the cube and onto the table.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Had a good rest?" Kuro smirked. Dark rings had formed under his eyes from the non-stop session of livestreaming and he looked like he could fall asleep at any moment. Decro got off the table unsteadily and stumbled to his feet as he tried to shake off the numbing stiffness in his limbs. His body had been immobile for so long, it was as if his body had forgotten how to move.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The noonday sun was still shining in the sky, but Decro knew that an entire day had passed since he last saw it. His eyes flicked to the computer screens and he noticed that the stream was still running. Four thousand people were watching him experience freedom for the first time in what felt like an eternity in darkness.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'm headed to sleep after this," the fox said with a yawn before turning to the wolf, "But first, Decro?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hmm?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, the stream hit the next milestone of two-hundred-and-fifty K subscribers, and the promised reward is..." Kuro placed a box on the table, slightly small than the one Decro had just emerged from. "Another cube!" the fox declared enthusiastically.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'm not getting into that," the wolf shook his head, frowning, "You already locked me in that box for an entire day without warning me, so I don't trust you on this one."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hey...don't put it like that," Kuro pleaded, giving a hurt look, "I just wanted it to be a surprise for you."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro glared suspiciously at the fox.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Please?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf grunted with a hint of annoyance. He didn't want to be stuck in a cramped box for another day without his consent.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"I'm not–" he began, but a jingle played on Kuro's speakers, alerting the two to a new donation. The donor's message was read out by a robotic voice synthesizer: "Here's two-hundred dollars for our favourite streamer. And to that handsome wolf that's with Kuro, give him your support too! What's a bit more time in the cube?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Please?" Kuro piped up before Decro could respond. The wolf looked at the camera begrudgingly, as if giving his audience an expression of disdain. "Fine," he conceded, rolling his eyes, "How long are you keeping me inside?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ten minutes," the fox reassured, pointing to a ten-minute countdown timer on his computer screen. That wasn't too long. Decro nodded reluctantly as Kuro opened the side of the box. This time, there was no padding in the cube, and the wolf felt his skin press against the sides of the box, cushioned only by his soft fur.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Suddenly, the fox grabbed his left wrist and strapped it to the top corner of the box with a leather cuff that was mounted on its side.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What the-" Decro gasped in a mixture of surprise and exasperation. Kuro ignored his interjection and restrained the wolf's right hand on the other side. "What's this for?" Decro growled.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You'll see," the playful fox winked, securing the wolf's ankles to the bottom corners of the box in the same way. With the wolf trapped and vulnerable, Kuro began to stroke the canine's bulge.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hey...hngg..." Decro groaned in protest, "W-why—"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"You'll see," Kuro repeated, teasing the wolf's cock out of its sheath. Decro blushed as he was unwillingly aroused in front of thousands of watchers. But there was no stopping it as his shaft was soon rock-hard beneath his tight trunks, forming a sizable bulge in full view of his unseen but eager audience.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The fox then picked up a black tube with a rubber ring around its tip. Using Decro's leaking precum as a natural lubricant, he slowly forced the erect dong into the tube until the tight ring was pressed against the top of the wolf's knot. Decro let out a soft whine of pain, but Kuro only pushed harder. There was a light pop as the knot was forced through the ring where it sat securely, keeping the wolf perpetually erect. Kuro then tucked the cock back into the tight trunks before giving the encased bulge a firm rub.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What's this for?" Decro protested, trying to suppress the mixture of pleasure and pain in his voice.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, depending on what happens, you could be here for longer than ten minutes. This is just in case you need to...relieve yourself."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"What?" the wolf shouted angrily, struggling against his restraints. They didn't give, keeping stuck in the cube.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Every dollar donated allows the donor to either add or deduct ten seconds to the timer," Kuro grinned.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>As if on cue, the donation jingle played, accompanied by the message: "I'm doing my part to keep our wolfy boy safe! Here's a sixty!" The numbers on the timer began increasing until it came to a stop at twenty minutes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hey! That's not what we agreed—mfft!" he was interrupted as the muzzle was strapped over his face.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Don't worry, I'll take good care of you while you're in your cube," Kuro purred, closing the lid and plunging the captive wolf back into darkness. Ignoring the muffled pleas coming from the box, Kuro yawned loudly.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Well, thanks for supporting my twenty-four-hour stream, but I should really get some sleep before I pass out. I'll leave the stream up so you guys can continue watching Decro in my stead," Kuro paused as another yawn escaped his mouth, "KuroGame, signing off."</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Days passed by with Decro kept in his cramped confinement. He had been stuck in the box, feeling more and more frustrated at Kuro with each waking moment. He had been fed with a diluted nutrient solution that kept him barely fed and hydrated, keeping him in a constant state of lethargy and light-headedness.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He would hear Kuro get up each day, stream games for his audience for hours on end, then take the rest of the day to edit his videos. Every now and then, Kuro would knock on the box to make sure he was still alive, and Decro would respond with a grudging grunt. After the fox went to bed, hours of silence would follow, punctuated by numerous donations that extended his time in the cube. All the while, a camera was focused on the inconspicuous cube with two tubes running into its sides, allowing its prisoner to be fed and drained.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Time seemed to be simultaneously flying by, yet standing still. Temporal perception tends to be like that when put in sensory deprivation for long periods of time. And all the captive wolf could do was to wait.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And wait.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>And wait.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A bright light blinded the wolf as the long-unseen sun once again assaulted his eyes.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mftt..." he groaned groggily. The muzzle was unfastened, letting the fresh air cool his skin down. That relief was to be short-lived, however, as a gas mask was pulled over his face. Its front was modified so that it had a hollow tube mouthpiece that forced its way into Decro's maw, keeping it open and vulnerable. The latex hugged his face tightly, pressing its dark-tinted lenses against his eyes. A tube was screwed over the mouthpiece, replacing his previous feeding tube. Not a good sign.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"My viewers were extra generous with you," Kuro announced cheerily, "You've been here for...about two weeks now, and if I didn't stop the timer you would be here for the next five years or so." Decro grunted grumpily in response, tugging weakly against the straps that held him in the box.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So I changed up the rules a little, and upped the stakes," the fox continued, "We'll reduce the length of your confinement, but there will be a few changes..." Kuro unbuckled the leather restraints and stepped back.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>All of a sudden, Decro's view of the outside was suddenly obscured by the opening of a third, smaller box. One that would barely be enough for the wolf's shoulders to slot comfortably between each side of the cube.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hnfftng!" the wolf protested feebly, but there was no getting out of his predicament. The smaller box was pushed into the bigger one, and the entire setup was tilted so that Decro's huddled form was forced to slide towards the smaller box. His legs slid into his residence-to-be, but his head and bum were stuck at the narrow entrance.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kuro, however, continued tilting the two boxes until their combined centre of mass tipped over the side, and gravity pulled them down with a loud slam. The impact, combined with the force of gravity, pushed the wolf through the entrance of the smaller box. He hit the metal base of the box with a sound of bone against steel. "Gwarr..." he groaned in pain through the gag in his mouth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The small size of the cube became even more apparent now that Decro was forced to be inside. His shoulder blades were pressed painfully against the sides of the box, and his face was pressed against its bottom. He had to tilt his body to the side a little to ease the stress on his bones. He let out a soft, desperate whimper from behind his gas mask, but Kuro ignored it.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The bigger box was taken away, but Decro was still stuck with his head facing the ground. His rump was facing the top of the box, vulnerable to Kuro's advances. Sure enough, the fox tugged the wolf's trunks down, revealing the canine's tailhole. Decro shivered as cold lubricant was squeezed on his pucker and smeared around the entrance. Then came the buttplug. Its wide body was forced into Decro as he tried to resist.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ghfft!" he yelped in agony as its girth spread his insides apart beyond the point of comfort. It slid in until his muscles were clenched around the narrow base of the plug, too sore to try and expel the anal intruder. Kuro then reached into the wolf's trunks and strapped a vibrator to his tube-encased cock. Decro's trunks were then pulled back into place, and a metal cover was secured over the box. Some effort was required to push Decro's round butt down, compressing his body into the cube, but soon enough Kuro had fastened the lid in place.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Soft whimpers could be heard from within as the fox turned the box so that Decro was upright again. Then there were a few moments of silence as Decro sat huddled in the cramped darkness.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"The rules are the same, but now it's a dollar per second so you guys don't abuse the system," he could hear Kuro announce to his stream, and he heaved a sigh of relief. He was being imprisoned against his will, but at least his freedom would be closer, right?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Five dollars and you can change the setting of the... 'toys'," continued Kuro, "Come on now, give it a go." Then it was quiet. Suddenly, the vibrators came to life. His cock was stimulated by the bullet vibrator strapped to it, and the anal plug in his tailhole was teasing his sensitive muscles. His helpless yelps were picked up by the microphone and broadcasted on the stream.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Very nice! Feel free to change it up, edge him harder, or deny him the pleasure. I'll leave it to you guys."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It was only a matter of time because the vibrations were increased to the maximum level, milking the wolf of all his precum. But before he could get his release, the vibrations were toned down to an unsatisfying hum. "Mmmmngg!" he pleaded helplessly. He was stuck. He was in pain. And now, he was sexually denied.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>How could this get any worse?</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He had been stuck in this box for days, maybe weeks, or even months now. He had been fed nothing but nutrient water and had his liquid waste cleared. He had been teased and milked and teased again. Turned into a toy against his will.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He let out another pitiful whimper, wishing that maybe his audience might feel sorry for him and call off their relentless assault.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>It wasn't happening now, but he could only hope.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro was feeling weak when the cube was once again opened and his stiff body was pulled out of it. The dark-tinted world around him reminded him of the fact that his face was still secured in the gas mask.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He groaned groggily. "Three months," he could hear Kuro say to his streamers. It felt like forever. But he was too dazed to notice what was happening as the fox tugged his underwear off him before removing the cock tube and anal plug. The rubber ring over his dick, however, was left in place to keep his member fully erect.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"That's a lot of precum you're leaking," Kuro teased, giving the tapered tip of the canine's cock a light squeeze before lugging Decro into the confines of yet another box. The walls of the box were made of metal painted matt black. The wolf was left lying on his side, curled up within. This cube, however, felt more spacious.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Since we've reached the milestone of a million subscribers, there's a new reward in store for you, coming at the expense of Decro, of course."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf mumbled incoherently, too overwhelmed by fatigue to form a cohesive plea for freedom. In the meantime, Kuro walked over to the side of the box where Decro's head was. Adjusting the canine's maw so that he was facing the top of the box, he secured the mouth opening of the wolf's gas mask to a hole in the centre of the face.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>He then walked over to the opposite side where Decro's rump was. Like the other side, there is a hole in the centre of the cube's face. A hollow buttplug is mounted over the hole on the inside of the box, forming a tunnel. Kuro adjusted the wolf until the plug was situated over his pucker, and pushed him onto the toy.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hnng..." came the soft whimper. Decro's mouth was now connected to the hole on one side of the cube, and his tailhole formed the opening on the other side. A third hole in front of Decro sat ominously.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The five walls of the box were mounted on a contraption which held them in place, albeit spread apart with gaps in between. No wonder the box felt more spacious. However, that was soon about to change as the fox began to turn a wheel, which caused the walls to start coming together.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Once this box is fully tightened, Decro will not be able to move an inch," Kuro informed his audience, "And this time, he's not getting out." As the walls came together, the wolf was forced to arc backwards as his mouth and tailhole were squeezed together. His soft whines had turned into louder yelps for help, compelled by what little energy he could muster. </span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>When the front wall of the box was close enough to Decro's red rocket, Kuro guided its tip through the hole so that it poked out of it. Then, he resumed his closing of the box. Decro's eyes darted around frantically from behind the dark lenses of his gas mask as his prison walls closed in on him. His shaft was pushed through the hole until its opening was in line with the rubber ring keeping his cock erect.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Kuro paused to secure the rubber ring to the edges of the hole before once again returning to tighten the box. Smaller and smaller, narrower and narrower. The cold metal was pressed against him on all sides, from his face to his arms, from his rump to his thighs. The wolf felt like his spine could snap, and that his bones could crack, but still Kuro continued.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Pain flooded the canine's mind as he was forced to endure the agony of his body being compressed in on all sides. Only when the sides of the box touched each other did the fox finally stop. It was so constricted, each attempt to move was only met with steel against his skin.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Stuck in the cube, Decro could hear the sound of sparks. Kuro was using an arc welder to weld the edges together, constructing his permanent confinement. One by one, the edges were fused together, forming the seamless borders of the box. Once he was done, the fox stood over the tiny cube. Its length was only slightly longer than his forearm, which made the compression of the wolf even more impressive.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Decro shuddered in fear as he looked up at Kuro. It had all started so innocently, but now the permanence of his situation had started to truly sink in. He was afraid and with good reason. All the fox had to do was to weld on a sixth side to keep him in there forever.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But that was not the plan. Not yet. Kuro picked up a rubber sleeve and began squeezing generous amounts of glue onto it. He then began to slide it over Decro's cock, giving it a shiny latex skin. A whimper came from behind the gas mask, one mixed in with a twisted combination of arousal and terror. The sleeve was pulled over his member until it reached the base of his knot.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The fox began stroking the rubber as if jerking Decro off, smearing the adhesive inside all over the wolf's dick, making sure that every bit of rubber would be permanently stuck against his sensitive skin. "Mgnnn..." the wolf groaned.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With a smirk, the fox picked up a heavy bucket. Tipping it gently, he poured a thick and black liquid over Decro's tightly-squeezed body. His eyes widened when he realized what it was: liquid rubber. The latex level rose up against his side, then up to his chest. His eyes were also covered up before it encased top of his shoulder.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The last piece of metal was then pressed over the latex and welded on all sides. Once the latex cooled and hardened around the wolf, there was absolutely no way he would be able to move. This would be the last cube and final cube that Decro would ever find himself in. After all, he would be in there forever.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hey, what's up gamers?" Kuro's livestream came to life as the fox popped his head in front of his camera and greeted enthusiastically, "KuroGame here once again. This time we break from the scheduled games to announce some very special donor updates.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"So as you guys can see from the side panel, we've hit our stretch goal of ten million subscribers, and that means I have a very special stream lined up for you. With me today is Kyngios and Draco," the fox waved two people over, pointing first to a dark grey wolf, followed by a blue and black sergal, who both waved back.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"They are my second and first runner up in the donor's challenge, so I'll be rewarding them with a good time today," the fox stepped to the side to reveal a black box on a narrow waist-high table, with a black-coloured phallus mounted on top. Kyngios stood on one side of the cube, and Draco on the other. Kuro gave the cock a squeeze, eliciting a reluctant moan from the box. Inside it was Decro lying face up, contorted uncomfortably so that his mouth, tailhole, and cock lined up with the circular openings of the cube.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Mr Hot Stuff has been forced into smaller and smaller cubes over the past few months, but this is his newest home, and this time, it's permanent," he announced cheerily, unfazed by the plight of the cube's prisoner, "But all good things must come to an end, so this will be the last we see of Cube-boy over here. That's why we have Draco and Kyngios to wrap up his time on the KuroGame stream." He turned to them and asked, "Are you boys ready?"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The sergal and wolf nodded and grinned as they unzipped their pants, apparently already prepared for what is to come. The wolf was wearing a blue neoprene jockstrap while the sergal sported latex trunks with a sheath. Both of them presented their cocks, directing them towards the hole on their side of the box.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Give it all you've got."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf and sergal plunged their cocks, knot and all, into the latex-lined hole. There was a gasping yelp of surprise from Decro as he was invaded from both ends. Draco was fucking his mouth while Kyngios was abusing his tailhole.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>With Decro's mouth kept open with the gas mask's latex tube in his maw, he was helpless to resist as the girthy shaft in his mouth ignored his gag reflex and sunk itself into his throat. He could feel his gullet forced open by the cock's tapered tip, pressing it firmly against the solid latex that encased his body.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>His rear was likewise ravaged by the canine cock as it rubbed against his sensitive muscles. Each thrust tore through his insides until the dick was tenaciously pounded against his prostate. Decro's desperate whimpers were fraught with agony, muffled by the cock that filled his mouth.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The box was shuddering on the table, both from the rocking of the two tops and from the internal trembling of the victim. Still, neither Draco nor Kyngios stopped what they were doing. Kuro joined in the fun, grabbing Decro's latex-encased cock and pumping it with firm and careful movements. He started with slow strokes, gradually working the captive towards the edge with rapid pumps, only to let go and deny the victim his orgasm at the last moment.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Draco's and Kyngios' gasps and moans filled the room, accompanied by Decro's howls of pain and sexual frustration. Donations were coming in as tens of thousands watched the entire scene in glee. The abuse of the cubed wolf was a spectacle just too captivating to look away from.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dominating wolf and sergal were unfazed by the invisible crowd. Instead, they continued exploiting their respective fuckhole as they fed their arousal. Slowly but surely until they...</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Ghrr!" both of them grunted and gasped in unison as they climaxed, filling Decro from both ends with their thick, warm seed. The trapped wolf almost choked as cum was pumped down his throat. He tried to cough some of it out as Draco withdrew his cock, but with his mouth gagged open, he could only let the residual trickle out. At the other end, the black latex was made shiny by the contrasting, silky stains that overflowed from the tight pucker.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>But Kuro was not done yet. He continued jerking the rubber cock off, feeling its rapid throbbing in his hands until the inevitable orgasm came: copious amounts of jizz shot out of the tip like a spunk fountain, coating the box with sticky seed.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The fox let go and stepped back, wiping his hands with a cloth as the three of them admired the aftermath of their efforts. "Did you guys enjoy that?" Kuro turned to the camera and smiled cheerfully, "Gotta thank Decro for granting us this...gift. So let's give him a good send-off. For that, we have our first-place donor, Fang, to join us."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Draco and Kyngious moved out of view of the camera as a red dragon with a handsome yellow mane approached the box. Giving his watchful audience a wave, he picked up a rubber dildo from the table. He smeared it against the cum leaking out of Decro's mouth before shoving it forcefully into his maw, not letting a drop of seed go to waste.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The wolf let out a soft yelp in response. His breathing was now laboured as his only source of oxygen was through a narrow channel in his dildo gag. Fang continued, taking an anal plug and nudging it against Decro's sore tailhole. A soft whimper could be heard through the gag, making the process more pleasurable as the dragon forced the toy into the rubber hole.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>There was a painful groan of pain as the wolf's pucker was stretched around the girth of the plug. But with the help of the natural, white lubricant, Decro's tailhole swallowed the plug and squeezed its narrow neck. Fang gave the toy's base a tug, teasing the wolf's insides before giving it a firm pat.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Lastly, he grabbed Decro's cock and pressed it flat against the surface of the cube. There was some resistance as the wolf's forced erection made it painful for his dick to be bent like that, but the dragon made sure to push harder in response. A latex pouch was then secured over his manhood, turning it into a null bulge on the top of the cube, tucking the toy away safely until it was meant to be used again.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Fang rubbed the bulge, smearing Decro's own seed all over his rubber cock under the rubber surface. When he was satisfied, he cleaned up the residual cum with a cloth before nodding at Kuro. "Guess we're done here then," the fox announced to the camera, "Thank you for joining us as we watched Decro's journey from underwear model to cubic fucktoy. And of course, our champion donor gets to keep him!"</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>The dragon picked up the cube and took it out of the room. Decro could hear Kuro's trailing voice as he was taken away. "So if you want to win more fabulous prizes just as Fang did, don't forget to donate and subscribe. Now, back to our schedule of games! Today, we will be playing..."</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>"Hnfft..." Decro groaned from within his cubic latex encasement. He was stuck. Well and truly stuck. And if today was any indication of what is to come, he didn't like it whatsoever. But what could he do?</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>After all, he was now nothing more than a cube.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>A fucktoy.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Ready to be used and abused at its owner's will.</span></div><div class="paragraph-break"></div><div class="paragraph align-left"><span>Forever.</span></div></div><div class="segment-break"></div><div class="segment"><div class="paragraph align-center"><span>~ End ~</span></div></div></div></div></div>
