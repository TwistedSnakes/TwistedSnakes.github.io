        Okay. I...I need to calm down. Shit, I'm crying now. Please... Okay, okay. Get it together. It's dark, so I'll need to feel around me. It's a narrow box made out of cheap plywood. It's rough to the touch and covered with splinters. Ugh. I'm stuck lying down on my back, with not a lot of space to work with. There's just enough of a gap to bring my hand up to my chest with a bit of difficulty, but other than that, there's not much space to move.

        Gotta control my breathing. My panting breaths are extra loud in my ears, trapped in the wooden confines of this death box. Okay. Okay. Stop crying. Stop crying. I've got this. I've got this. I've got this. I need to calm down.

        I'm fine now. My breathing is fine. I just need to take my time, figure things out. I'm stuck in a box. They nailed the lid on, then they lowered me into this grave before piling the dirt on. How deep down am I?

        Okay, okay. I can't keep doing this. I need to save oxygen. Dammit, I'm crying again. But I'm not dying here. Not in this stupid box. Shit. If only there's someone I can call. Call...call...wait! I can just about reach my hand into my jeans' pocket and...YES! My phone! My phone is still here. There's not enough space to look at my screen, so I have to turn my head to the side and face my phone. Twenty percent of battery. I'm fine. Police. Police. Nine-one-one.

        And figure this out. People have done it before, I think. I've read an article a few years back where a man got out from being buried alive due to some horrible mistake. It used to feel so far away. Like it happened in another world. Like it would never have happened to me. But now, I know what it feels like to be stuck under tons of dirt like that.

        I'm going to try the bottom. I press my hands against the side to give myself some hold as I edge my way to the foot of the coffin. I pull my legs in as far as I can bring them, and then I stomp hard on the wood. There's a loud thud, but the wood isn't giving. I try again, feeling the shock of the impact through the wooden panel beneath me. One more, but still, nothing happens. I think the dirt is keeping it in place.

        I'm getting light-headed. There's not a lot of time left. I need to escape. Don't panic. Don't panic. I'll try the sides. I tilt my hips to the left and bring my knees up. My kneecaps press against the left wall as I press my heels against the right wall.

        I strain the muscles in my legs as I push hard. There's the sound of wood creaking. And then...

        The wood shudders as it comes free of the nails. Dirt falls over my sneakers, caking my socks and soles with fresh, damp earth. It's heavy on my feet, but that means freedom.

        I turn to face the new opening. The nails at the top of the plank of wood are now exposed, and loose ground has slid down its surface. It's a start, but I'm not out of the woods yet.

        Using what little space I have, I take off my shirt and wrap it around the lower half of my face. That's another tactic I remember from buried survivors: tie the shirt around your head to stop yourself from swallowing or breathing in the soil. But I still need to see, so just covering my mouth and nose will do.

        I dig at the dirt with my hands, using my forearms to slide the earth into the bottom of the coffin. Slowly but surely, I'm making a hollow space in the ground beside me. I start excavating the earth upwards, still pushing it into the coffin. The hole is taking shape: it's just wide enough for me to squeeze my shoulders through the gap in the earth. I'm running out of space in the coffin anyway, so I gotta move.

        I kick off the mound of dirt that has already gathered at the bottom of my wooden prison, pushing myself out the side of the coffin and through the gap. The hollow is just about large enough to fit my shoulders, with a bit more to dig up. It's uncomfortable as skin touches the bare earth, but the shirt over my nostrils are helping to filter out the falling soil.

        I'm now half-kneeling in the dirt. If I keep displacing it, pushing it down as I make my way up, I'll be able to reach the surface and escape. I'll be free!

        I reach up to feel the ground above me. It's damp, sticking together in chunks as I burrow into it. My fingers dig into a huge slab of clumped dirt. I'll need to move it to the side, carefully. Just need to...

        I'm trying to control my breathing. I can feel the loose soil around me shift as my chest rises and falls, slowly getting packed around it as gravity compacts the debris together. Don't panic. Don't panic. I can't move. Help. Don't cry. Stop. Stop.

        The shirt around my face loosens with my movement and more soil falls around me. It's getting in my nostrils! My mouth! Fuck. I can taste it in my mouth. A disgusting mouthful filled with an overwhelming sting of salty and sour tastes. Dirt. Probably the remains of hundreds of dead bugs. The waste of fauna. Fuck. My gag reflex kicks in and I choke on the soil, trying to expel it from my mouth. But that only just makes it worse. Fucking gravity is shovelling the death-particles down my damn throat! I can't do this!

        But my lungs betray me and I gasp for air, sucking more soil up my nose, clogging it up with grains of dirt. Small, but the moment it's in your nose, it feels like pebbles being forced down your nasal passage. That's how it feels.
