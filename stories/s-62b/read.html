        Luxury was a word that came to Kazuki's mind as he leaned against the soft leather of the armchair he was seated in. The entire room didn't have much furniture; only two armchairs and the table between them. But the deep brown of the wood with its intricate carvings and inlaid gold trimmings matched well with the ochre of the smooth leather that slid effortlessly beneath the wolf's fingertips. He shifted in his seat, making himself comfortable. Despite being in his most formal of attires, he felt almost underdressed.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Beneath the high ceiling, glowing orbs flowed on invisible wires, moving them through the air above the wolf with deliberate motions in an intricate dance of the heavens. The music of a classical piano played softly, almost as if instead of breaking the silence, it was harmonizing with it.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Quiet moments were rare in the casino; all around the wolf should have been the sound of clattering roulette wheels and cheering gamblers. But here in this room, the rest of the world faded away, as though the room refused to follow the rules of reality and conform to the norm.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Opposite Kazuki sat the other chair, expectantly empty. But his patience needn't be tested, for, sure enough, the wooden door opened and Sephos entered: a tall, dark-scaled snake with a chiselled face and sculpted body. He wore a silver suit that would've looked tacky on anyone else, but on him, its snow-white contrasted the jet-black of his scales to the point that Kazuki would be baffled trying to imagine another colour that'd look better on him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The snake's steps were deliberate as he made his way over to Kazuki. Passing over the empty seat, he instead strode over to the wolf. Kazuki tilted his head up to face him as he approached.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Did you have to wait long?" he asked in a deep voice that sent shivers down the wolf's spine.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Nah, I just got here," Kazuki shrugged back, giving him a reassuring grin.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The snake stroked the wolf's chin with the back of his index finger, gently teasing the soft fur of the canine's neck. The sides of a contented smile began at the sides of the wolf's lips and he let out a soft, involuntary purr. They spent a few indulgent minutes this way, with Sephos' soft caresses brushing against Kazuki's sensitive skin.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        But their fun had only just started. The real gratification was yet to come. The snake stroked the bottom of the wolf's lips with his thumb before lowering his hand to his side. "Let's go," he tilted his head towards the door beckoningly, "The room's waiting for us." Sephos smiled warmly, offering Kazuki his hand. The wolf took it, feeling the serpent's grip as he pulled yourself up, strong and firm, warm and supportive. With the snake still holding the wolf's hand, he made for the door, leading the canine with him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The door opened and the rest of the world flooded back in. They were back in the game hall filled with tables set up with games of poker, roulette, and many more that even a gambling expert would find hard-pressed to name from the top of their head. The flashes of colourful lights, the roar of rumbustious gamblers. All the symptoms of a popular casino, especially one as successful as the Silver Serpent.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        But these were merely distractions, fading away into the background like white noise as Kazuki focused on the suave serpent beside him, taking him through the crowd like a ship's prow cutting the sea. Sephos' dark scales seemed to absorb the hues of the lighting, his white suit impervious to their incessant flashing.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The stares of the casino's other patrons fell upon the two of them. Two handsome furs making their way through the world of public scrutiny, headed towards their oasis of privacy. Kazuki's shoulders tensed up at their attention. Sephos, seemingly reading his mind with one glance, leaned in and nuzzled the side of his cheek with his own. Smooth scales against gentle fur.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span class="italic">
        What did their stares matter anyway?
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki blushed. Sephos stood up straight and gave the wolf a reassuring smile, one that he returned gratefully. The world's stares melted away as they continued through the centre of the hall, down a path lined with red, plush carpet.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        They entered the elevator lobby where Sephos took out his membership card and tapped it on the sensors beside the entrance. The chrome-plated metal doors to one of the eight elevators opened and Kazuki followed Sephos inside, keeping up with his swift and purposeful strides.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The doors closed and the noise of the crowd fell away. They were alone now. Kazuki could feel his heart pounding in his chest from sheer eagerness of what was to come. The privacy. The attention. The intimacy.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        As they stood side by side, Sephos's hand reached for Kazuki, allowing the back of his fingers stroke against the wolf's crotch. Kazuki's bulge of anticipation met the serpent's knuckles and the canine began moving his hips, rubbing against the scalie's slow but firm caresses. The wolf let out a soft, involuntary moan. If it were up to him, Sephos would've taken him there and then. Ravage his restless body. Satisfy his ravenous cravings.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        But Sephos' self-control tempered his, and Kazuki contented himself with a helpless grin across his face. Good things take time. There would be no raunchy crotch-squeezes, no lewd groping. Not in the elevator, anyway; all these will be saved for the privacy of the room.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The serpent drew his hand back, seconds before the elevator slowed to a halt. The two of them turned out into the spacious corridor. Unlike the corridors of the lower floors, this one had double doors for each room, each one spaced far apart from each other to accommodate the rooms' larger sizes.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        As Sephos approached one of the doors, it swung open automatically, revealing an elaborate living room inside. Couches surrounded a coffee table as they faced a widescreen television built into the wall. On the balcony was an outdoor, private jacuzzi. Slow, sensual music played from hidden speakers with the notes themselves seemingly blending in with the walls of the room.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Despite being as grand as the rest of the Silver Serpent, there was a certain quality to it that set it apart from the other rooms. An air of elegance, an aura of sophistication. Kazuki could somehow feel everything with heightened clarity, as if the sight was somehow sharper, the smells were somehow richer, and the sounds were somehow clearer.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki followed Sephos in, feeling the thick carpet beneath his soles as he entered. The serpent took off his white jacket, hanging it on the standing coat rack as the wolf followed suit. Dress shoes were kicked to the side, followed by socks. Their eyes met for a few, long seconds before Sephos leaned in, nuzzling against Kazuki's neck.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Where do we begin?" he whispered, placing his palms on Kazuki's shoulders. A warm, reassuring weight that filled the wolf with a sense of comfort.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "You decide," Kazuki whispered back, nuzzling back with his eyes closed, feeling the cool, dark scales against his skin.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Fine by me," Sephos smiled. He stepped forward, guiding the wolf until the canine's back landed against the wall.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Hhff," Kazuki let out a soft gasp as his back pressed against the velvet-lined wall. The snake had nuzzled his snout against the underside of his neck, exploring the canine's sensitive skin with his nose.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki's eyes closed in bliss, tilting his head up as he exposed his neck. His hands found their way to Sephos' sides, stroking the muscular form that laid beneath the snake's silky shirt.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Sephos let out a low grunt as Kazuki's touch embraced his sides. He pushed himself closer, rubbing his cheek against the wolf's neck as his hands shifted to the wolf's chest, squeezing his firm pecs with equally firm presses.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Hnn..." the wolf moaned quietly, feeling the snake's body against his. His strong arms against his chest. Kazuki's palms to Sephos' abs, tracing their way up his sculpted body to his chest. Feeling with his fingers, he undid the top button of the snake's shirt.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Sephos pulled back slightly, turning to face the wolf's neck as he drew his tongue. With it, he began exploring Kazuki's neck, starting from his collarbone and moving up to his neck. He began taking the wolf's shirt off too, and both their hands danced down their chest and abs as the buttons came undone.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Sephos' huffs interposed with Kazuki's moans, resonant accompaniments to the string of pianic notes. Their fingers reached the bottom of their shirts, but Sephos' tongue caresses didn't stop as they stripped their bodies of their shirts, letting them fall to the floor like leaves in the autumn.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The serpent's tongue slid up the wolf's jawline until he found the canine's left ear. There, he began circling its tip around in slow, sensual motions, sending shudders through the wolf's body.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Mhngg!" Kazuki gasped.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The snake paused. "Still as sensitive there, I see," he mused out loud.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "S-shut up—hnftt!" the wolf was interrupted as Sephos dived in for a kiss, pressing his lips against the wolf's. Just a quick one, but enough to send Kazuki's head reeling. He then resumed licking his ear earnestly, moving his hands up to the back of the wolf's head, gently holding the wolf in place as he squirmed.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Ah, you're so cute like that," Sephos teased.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki opened his eyes with a smirk, as if taking the snake's remark as a challenge. He shoved against Sephos' chest, pushing the serpent backwards until he fell over the side of the couch, landing back-first onto its leather seats. Sephos' look of surprise turned into a smirk as Kazuki sat on the armrest, raising the snake's left foot to the right side of his face. The wolf gave a smug look as he began nuzzling against the snake's sole.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Sephos bit his lip as he tried to stifle a gasp. A bulge was swelling inside his pants and he could see the same held true for Kazuki. With his free foot, he began stroking the canine's member, firmly squeezing it with his toes.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "And you're cute like that," Kazuki teased back. He nuzzled against the snake's foot, feeling its smooth scales against his cheek. Against the bridge of his nose. Against his forehead. His lips. His jaw. His collarbone.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        At the same time, his gaze traced the curves of the snake's body. From the foot in front of his face. Down his muscular thighs. Settling on the serpent's generous bulge. Throbbing beneath those pants. Then his eyes pulled away, dancing up Sephos' sculpted abs, powerful pecs, and then to his handsome face.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Their eyes met. Sephos had been watching his admiring eyes. The snake's long and muscular tail embraced Kazuki's waist, curving up to his back and pulling him close. The wolf's two hands held the snake's foot determinedly, as if he was resolved to explore every inch of exposed scales and trace every curve of sole. The serpent was more than happy to oblige, making sure that both Kazuki's face and bulge had a generous helping of his feet.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Then without warning, Sephos' tail pulled the wolf in until they were chest to chest. "What the—" Kazuki gasped in surprise as he landed on the snake's sturdy torso. Their eyes met, holding each other's gaze.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Time passed.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        And then they leaned in, pressing their foreheads together and letting their warm breaths mix. Bulge-to-bulge they laid there. Their erections throbbing against each other, separated only by their attire.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        But that was soon to change. With the wolf still over him, Sephos undid the canine's pants and tugged them downwards. Kazuki shifted himself to accommodate the snake's movements, and soon his pants were off. His underwear bulge hung between his legs and he blushed.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>

        There was nothing to be shy about, however, as Sephos' gently stroked the outline of Kazuki's length with his finger, watching as it shuddered in response. Then with a swift movement, he grabbed Kazuki by the waist and sat up. With his strong tail supporting him, he got off the sofa, holding the wolf close to his body as he carried him into the bedroom

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        He lowered the canine onto the silk sheets of the king-sized bed and Kazuki sat on it, comfortably watching Sephos. The serpent took off his pants with purposeful movements, slipping them down as he revealed his own bulge. He then joined the wolf on the bed, pushing the canine back so that he was lying on his back before straddling him.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The serpent descended on the canine's chest, nuzzling against it as his right hand began to fondle the wolf's nipple. With his tongue, he began caressing the wolf's chest, making sure that every hill and valley of Kazuki's pecs had its fair share of attention.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Closing his eyes, Kazuki nuzzled back, stroking the underside of his jaw against the snake's forehead. His hands embraced Sephos' torso, gripping the muscular ridges of his back. The serpent had started to stroke his cheek against the side of the wolf's neck, making the canine gasp involuntarily.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The wolf shifted his head down, giving himself access to the serpent's chest. His lips kissed the snake's abs, tracing their way across his body. Sephos let out another yielding grunt, feeling Kazuki's lips, tongue, and skin explore his body. At the same time, he reached down where the wolf's bulge was, and clasped it firmly, giving it a light tug.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        They both let out moans of pleasure. The air around them felt like it was heating up, warming their exerting bodies. Sephos got up, and Kazuki half-opened his eyes, only to catch a glimpse of the snake's black scales descending upon his lips.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        They kissed once more, this time exploring each other's mouths at their own pace. A dance of their lips. The greeting of their tongues. Their tongues pushed past each other, tracing the insides of each other's mouths as the other sucked back in response.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        And then Sephos pulled back. Slowly getting up into a sitting position, he shifted closer until he was straddling Kazuki's face. The snake's bulge pressed against the wolf's muzzle, who proceeded to close his eyes and nuzzle back. The wolf focused on his non-visual senses. The soft fabric of the snake's compression trunks. The firm bulge that was held snugly within the material. The serpent's weight against his chest. The light musk from the snake's member.

       <span>
        Kazuki's hands grabbed Sephos' sides, pulling him closer as he pushed his face against the reptile's bulge. The snake was slowly thrusting against his muzzle, a steady rocking of hips.

        "Mngg..." he moaned softly from beneath the snake's cock, tracing the lines beneath the fabric. The entire length of the shaft. The tapered tip. And a hint of precum. Sephos' hands stroked the wolf's head, his fingers combing through his hair, lightly tousling them.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The snake was panting, indulging himself in the wolf's efforts. Fur against scales. Their hearts beating quickly in their chest. Their body heat trapped against each other. Kazuki was close, and Sephos could tell. The snake slowly got off Kazuki's face, moving backwards until he was facing the canine's bulge. With his hand, he began to rub the dick within with slow, stroking motions.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki looked on with dreamy eyes, the whole world covered by a lens tinted with the colours of arousal. Sephos' fingers reached the top of the underwear and he gradually pulled it down, as if taking in the unveiling of the wolf's cock and balls. He let the elastic sit behind the canine's balls as he leaned forward. Keeping his eyes on Kazuki, he stuck out his tongue and stroked the erect shaft before him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The wolf let out a short gasp and squirmed on the bed as the erotic sensations assaulted his body. The warm tongue of the snake was helping itself to every inch of his exposed cock, caressing his shaft, stroking the ridge of his glans, and circling its tip. Sephos then drew his tongue back in, pressing his thumb against the underside of Kazuki's dick and sliding down to its base. The canine threw his head back against the pillow, letting his body do the talking as he basked in the pleasure.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Sephos got up, tugging his underwear down and revealing his own sceptre, tall and erect. Still kneeling upright as he straddled Kazuki's hips, he pressed the base of his dick against the wolf's, letting them sit lengthwise against each other. Using the beads of precum at the tip of his cock, he began lubricating both rods, giving them a smooth sheen.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        He started the slow frot. Holding both shafts in his fist, he began slowly pressing them together as he gradually worked them, as if letting both of them luxuriate in the sensations. Their throbbing pulses. The spreading warmth. The awaited arousal.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">

        Their low moans filling the room with their reverberations.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Then he began pumping. Their flesh being jerked off in unison as their hips thrust against each other. Kazuki could feel his body's libido worked to its peak as his cock was rubbed against Sephos'. The way the serpent's fingers were working their shafts. The way that Sephos was lost in his euphoria too. All of them pushing the right buttons.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Ngnn!" he gasped, and Sephos grunted blissfully in response.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The snake, too, was basking in the experience. The feeling of tightness over his rod as he pumped it was divine. His body was tensed up, ready to go at any moment. But he would be patient. He would take all the time in the world to treasure this very moment. Just a while more until...
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki's hips jerked as he climaxed, and Sephos let go at the same time. The both of them shared the orgasm, pumping out jet after jet of cum, staining the smooth sheets with their combined seed.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Their moans turned into panting as the last of their load trickled out from their tips. Tired, Sephos lowered himself, falling heavily on the bed beside Kazuki, facing him. The wolf turned to face the snake too, and their eyes met.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The silence hung in the air. It wasn't the oppressive kind of silence, the kind that makes everyone feel a sense of profound discomfort, but the compassionate kind, the kind that felt as if the universe had stopped in its tracks and turned to look at them.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        They held each other's gaze for an eternity, maybe two. And then they embraced, pulling each other's body close, as if trying to squeeze the effects of reality out from between them.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        And maybe, just maybe, they could have this moment forever.
