        And suspended in this sea of nothingness was a silent, solitary spaceship. A patrol ship of the Proioxis empire, cleaving its streamlined hull through the void of lifeless planets and asteroids.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Deep within the ship was a maintenance workshop. As the fifty soldiers on the ship went about with their duties, their equipment would sometimes be in need of repair, be it from wear and tear or accidental damage, and this workshop was the sole service point for them.
       </span>

        Manning the workshop was an arctic wolf, leaning on the white, metal cuboid that functioned as the worktable of the workshop, big enough to fit the entire length of a large exosuit. The live feed of space was streamed and projected on the LED walls, making the room feel as if it were floating in the middle of space itself. The wolf sighed, gazing wearily as the planets drifted lazily by. Although they were hurtling through space at an immense speed, the astronomical scale of space made the journey feel protracted and banal.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The wolf's eyes were glazed over. They were a year into the three-year-long patrol so there would be quite some time to ride out before he would be home again, but already he was feeling the emotional strain of being away from home. And so he whiled away the time watching the void of space pass by.

        "Hey, Kaz!" a familiar voice called.
       </span>

        Kazuki turned around to see the only other arctic wolf on the ship: Officer Decro.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Hello," he smiled back, a sense of ease washing over his body. They were the only two arctic wolves on the entire ship and that alone was enough to get them to strike up their first conversation months ago, leading to their close friendship. "So what's the matter?" he nodded at the ACE exosuit Decro was wearing.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        ACE stood for Augmented Capabilities Equipage, which was little more than a fancy way of saying it enhanced one's body strength and endurance. It was standard-issue military gear for the space marines, although various attachments could be added to augment the suit's capabilities. The commander's exosuit, for instance, had additional modules installed to augment his vision with a map of the terrain, GPS-locate his men, and so on.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The exosuit itself consisted of two parts: an armoured exoskeleton with a skin-tight synthetic suit beneath. The suit hugged Decro's body tightly, measuring his biometrics as it kept track of his vitals. The exoskeleton enclosed the suit, connecting to it through various ports attached on the suit's chest, back, joints, and neck.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The suit would then send feedback of the soldier's movements to a computer in the exoskeleton, which would move the suit accordingly. The various pistons in the suit enhanced the soldier's physical strength and the instantaneous tactile feedback enhanced his dexterity.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        All in all, the ACE suit heightened Decro's combat skills, making him a formidable opponent in battle. But as with all equipment, these suits required maintenance and repair from time to time, which was likely the reason Decro was here in the first place.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Well," the officer limped into the workshop sheepishly. He was suited up to his neck, with the full-faced helmet retracted into the suit. In the meantime, the space display on the workshop walls faded away, returning it to a white, sterile-looking room with subtle blue strips of light lining its wall panels. "My ACE's walking cycle seems to be messed up after last week's training so moving about isn't the easiest thing to do now."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Last week? Why didn't you just look for me then?"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "I didn't want to disturb you," the officer shrugged, "Figured it'd fix itself if I left it alone."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "And how did that work out for you?" Kazuki teased, moving behind Decro, "You should've come earlier." He used a specialised tool to pry a panel off the armour on Decro's upper back, revealing an internal circuit board among other electronic parts.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Are you sure you're not saying that just so we can spend more time together?" the officer teased.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Shuddap," Kazuki retorted, trying to hide his grin. There was a socket against the back of the internal chamber, which he connected to a thick cable running out of the wall. Decro's body shuddered as the suit connected to the workshop's mainframe. A loud beep indicated that the diagnostics program had been installed and the exosuit was now wirelessly linked to the workshop's mainframe. With the connection in place, Kazuki unplugged the cable and replaced the back panel.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        There was the sound of soft chimes as the exosuit gathered information from its various sensors, feeding them to the workshop's mainframe that was built into the walls of the room. The mainframe then processed the data, turning them into information which Kazuki could make sense of.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        A panel in the middle of a wall flipped over, revealing a wide monitor screen that woke up with a gentle glow. The glow then faded away, leaving behind numbers and graphs. A diagram of Decro's suit was in the middle of the screen, surrounded by labels and even more numbers. A control panel slid out of the wall beneath the large display.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Let's run some diagnostics," Kazuki instructed, ignoring the screen as he tapped some buttons on the control panel, "I'll be taking over the ACE's controls for a few tests, so don't be alarmed."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Go right on ahead."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Commence physical diagnostics," Kazuki commanded the mainframe verbally, and almost immediately, Decro found his hands raised in front of him as the exosuit complied with the instructions being fed to it. Then his arms were stretched out on either side of him, before being directed back down to his sides.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Upper limbs look good," Kazuki mumbled to himself. The exosuit then began to swivel Decro's hips, before proceeding to limp a few paces forward.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Torso joints are looking good too," the engineer stared at the screen, "But as I suspected, something is wrong with your suit's lower limbs."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Erm, mind releasing the controls?" Decro asked. The suit was still locked in place, ignoring his attempts to move.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Whoops. Release ACE controls."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Thanks," Decro regained his movement and joined Kazuki in front of the screen.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Hmm," the engineer pondered as his eyes darted from number to number. Joint stress. Fluid pressure. Power dissipation. All of which made no sense to Decro, who watched the screen with a confused look on his face.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "So..." the officer stepped behind Kazuki and rested his chin on the engineer's shoulder, letting their cheeks touch as the soldier's hands wrapped around the engineer's waist. "What's going on?"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Small issue with the exosuit's right ankle, it seems," Kazuki shrugged, "Nothing severe."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Need me to de-suit?" Decro let go of the engineer and stepped back, allowing the engineer to face him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Nah, this is a quick fix. Raise your right leg, I'll get that joint sorted out."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Decro complied, lifting his foot and watching as Kazuki grabbed a ratchet wrench and laid on a mechanic's creeper. As Kazuki worked a joystick on the side of the creeper, its wheels spun, positioning his face beneath the officer's right foot.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        With the rachet, he removed the connectors holding the ankle armour plate in place and spotted the source of the problem almost immediately: a popped bolt that had lodged itself into the ankle joint.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Found the problem," Kazuki updated the officer as he put the bolt back in place, tightened it securely, and replaced the armour plate, "Solved. I guess we're done–"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The engineer was interrupted as Decro's foot descended on his face. The pressure was gentle, giving Kazuki only a little shock as the threaded foot of the exosuit pressed against his muzzle.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span class="italic">
        D-damn it! He liked the feeling of feet against his face, and Decro knew that fact very well.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Out of the corner of his eye, the engineer could make out a smug grin on the officer's face. Kazuki sneered back indignantly, but his slight annoyance soon gave way to indulgence as he closed his eyes and nuzzled back against the soft, padded sole of the armoured boot.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The pressure against his face was warm and inviting, heated up by the exosuit's thermostasis system. The thermostasis system was meant to keep the internal temperature of the ACE exosuit constant regardless of the temperature of the surroundings, protecting the wearer from harsh environments. But it was also useful for teasing arctic wolves who had a thing for feet, which Decro was currently capitalising on.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The suit was also keeping the officer's body stable, freeing him to massage his foot all over Kazuki's face without fear of losing balance. Down the side of his cheeks. Across his chin. Up against the side of his face. Then pressed against his forehead.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Mmm..." Kazuki let out a soft moan. The mechanic's jumpsuit was sleek and skintight, bringing out the curves of his muscular body. That also meant that his bulge was on display for Decro to see. Pausing his foot "therapy", he crouched down beside Kazuki and put one hand on his sizeable bulge.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "H-hey!" Kazuki protested, but only half-heartedly. His hip thrusts, however, were more enthusiastic, nudging his member against the officer's palm. Decro squeezed the engineer's crotch lightly, feeling Kazuki's body heat against his fingers. He could feel the shaft beneath the synthetic suit tense in response to his touch. His gropes. His squeezes.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Decro continued teasing the engineer, who was enjoying himself too much to stop him. Their time spent together would always be intimate. Sometimes they'd pour their hearts out to each other. Sometimes they'd talk about what they missed back at home. And sometimes...sometimes their emotional intimacy would encroach upon the physical realm, filling the hole left behind by loneliness and homesickness.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Someone's enjoying himself," Decro smiled as he let go of the bulge and stood up again.

        "You're the one who started–mfft..." Kazuki was once again distracted by the officer's foot in his face. His hands rose to grab Decro's armoured ankles and shin, feeling the streamlined body plates hug the soldier's muscular frame. His gaze traversed up Decro's leg, up his plated shins, then his thighs. The exoskeleton encased the officer's body securely, but through the gaps, Kazuki could make out where the inner suit gripped his sculpted body.

        Further up still, was the crotch plate: a hybrid armour piece that could sustain the heavy impact of projectiles and shrapnel, yet flexible enough to provide the full range of movement for the wearer. Its pliant form allowed it to grip the wearer's body beneath, conforming to a bulge that encased Decro's manhood.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki tried to hide his blush, pressing his face deeper still into the officer's foot. The exosuit had an extremely advanced tactile feedback system, allowing Decro to feel the engineer's face against his sole. Kazuki stroked the soldier's calf muscle and the suit made sure that Decro could feel every bit of it.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        He stole another glance, continuing his visual journey up Decro's abs. Up the chest plates. And to the officer's grinning face. Their gazes locked.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "You know I get really excited by this, right?" Kazuki mumbled sheepishly.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Yeah," Decro smiled, "Of course I do."

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki blushed even harder than before, rubbing his cheek against the curves of the sole. Feeling the plantar anatomy against the contours of his facial features. The warm, reassuring pressure against his cheekbones.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Mmm..." Kazuki muttered indignantly. But he remained there, still. The two of them indulging each other with their touches. Minutes seemed to stretch on forever. Just an officer taking a break from his regimental front to be his playful self, teasing an engineer who wanted the company but could never bring himself to ask for it.

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        After a long while, Decro took his foot off Kazuki's face, allowing him to get back on his feet. The mechanic's creeper automatically rolled back into a slot in the wall, and the wall panel slid into place, concealing it. In the meantime, Kazuki occupied himself by reading the display panel.

        "I said I was done with your suit," Kazuki stepped in front of the soldier, who was frozen awkwardly in mid-step, "But who says I'm done with you?"

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Decro grinned nervously, meeting Kazuki's eyes for signs of what was to come.

       <span>
        The exosuit complied, bringing Decro's foot down and standing him upright. He was now a passenger in his own body, only moving as Kazuki's instructions allowed. The engineer circled to the back of the soldier and wrapped his arms beneath Decro's, embracing his chest. His hands found their way to the officer's pecs and he gently squeezed.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Mffng..." it was Decro's turn to moan. The exosuit worked extremely well for situations like these. It could block out painful sensations as one would sustain during battle, but anything harmless could be conveyed to the wearer as is.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Oh fuck..." the soldier could barely hold it in. Kazuki had found where his sensitive nipples were located beneath the armour, circling them with firm presses and light squeezes. If the suit wasn't holding him still, his knees would have buckled weakly, and his body would have been shuddering in pleasure. But instead, only his face could reflect the euphoria he was feeling.

        A full-face helmet extended out of the suit and enclosed Decro's head within, concealing it inside black armour plates and a dark visor, giving him an anonymous, faceless appearance.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Stop worrying and just enjoy yourself," Kazuki nuzzled against the smooth cheek of the soldier's canine helmet.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Well..." Decro's voice trailed, but instead of coming from the suit, it came through hidden speakers built into the walls of the workshop. "Wait, what?" the soldier remarked in surprise.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "You know how the ACE is meant to be silent on the battlefield? That's why the helmet is soundproof, and your voice is transmitted via radio to other suits nearby," Kazuki explained. Decro tried to nod, only to remember his neck was still held in the unyielding grip of his exosuit.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "So," Kazuki continued, "Your voice is playing over the speakers because I wouldn't be able to hear you otherwise."

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Right," Decro spoke over the speakers. Kazuki grinned. It was as if the soldier was now a disembodied voice, leaving behind his muscular body for the engineer to play. To tease. To grope.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Decro's voice was silenced, leaving only Kazuki's soft moans as he felt up the firm bulge beneath his fingers.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "You're pretty turned on, aren't you," the engineer teased. Inside the suit, the wolf could only agree silently. Kazuki moved in front of Decro and knelt down so his face was level with Decro's crotch. He cupped the bulge with both his hands, gently squeezing and massaging it. His fingers traced the curves of the officer's shaft. The contours of his balls. His sensitive cockhead.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Inside the suit, Decro was enjoying the attention his manhood was receiving. The enclosure of the helmet echoed his moans back to him, making it hard to focus on anything else beyond the pleasurable sensations on his crotch.
       </span>
       <span class="italic">

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Suddenly, there was a light nip on his shaft. Kazuki was nuzzling against his bulge, gently taking his suit-clad cock in his mouth. Decro groaned, shifting his weight from one foot to another within the incapacitated suit. For all the sound and movement that he could make, he might as well have been an inanimate statue, helpless and vulnerable to all of Kazuki's advances.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Still, it wasn't like he could complain. Kazuki was enjoying himself, leaving behind all restraint as he lost himself to his instincts. Rubbing his face against the firm bulge. Lightly sucking against the shaft and testes. Licking every inch of the cock and balls that Decro had kindly left on display in his paralyzed form. On and on, Kazuki had his way with the officer's crotch until he was satisfied.

        "F-fuck..." Decro crumpled to the ground, trying to endure the overwhelming sensations he was feeling. His member was throbbing within its confined bulge, reluctantly eager for the powerful waves of pleasure that Kazuki was giving it. But the intoxicating arousal was making it impossible to even stand.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "What?" Decro was confused, but the exosuit made up for it. Taking over the controls, the suit walked the officer over to the table. With every step that Decro took, he groaned in ecstasy; the sensation of the floor against his feet was amplified tenfold, as though the tiles were massaging his soles in the most erotic way imaginable.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Mnn..." the walk over to the worktable was excruciatingly arousing, leaving Decro breathless by the time the suit was getting him onto the table. Kazuki laid back on the table while Decro found himself straddling him. He was merely a passenger in his body, coming along for the ride.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The faceless exosuit then lowered his body down, nuzzling his smooth surface against Kazuki's neck. At the same time, his crotch touched the engineer's, who began grinding his bulge back.

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "D-damn it!" Decro's voice spoke shakily through the speakers of the workshop. His already-aroused cock was sensitive as could be, so the amplified sensations did nothing to help his situation. His body was shivering uncontrollably, unseen from the outside as the suit restrained him in place.

        Kazuki, too, was indulging himself against the hunky, armoured body atop him, feeling up the soldier's plated chest, back, hips, and rump. His own dick was forming a tent in his suit as he ground it against Decro's. His moans mixed in with the officer's, filling the workshop with sounds of their sexual euphoria.

        The helmet once again enclosed Decro's head before he could protest, with only his desperate huffs to show for it. Kazuki continued exploration of the officer's body. His hands exploring the Decro's torso. His bulge grinding against the soldier's. The engineer was giving his all into his movements, thrusting and groping hard without restraint. Decro, too, would've been doing the same if not for his suit already doing the work for him.

        "Then why stop there?" Decro smiled. He slid his hand over Kazuki's crotch until he found a zipper. He unzipped it, slowly unveiling the engineer's erect cock. With a mental command, his suit opened the crotch hatch, revealing his own. Due to the difficulty of getting in and out of the suit, the hatch was built in to allow quick access during washroom breaks. But it was coincidentally perfect for situations such as these.

        Decro rested his rump on Kazuki's thighs, positioning himself so the bases of their dicks were pressed against each other. He then aligned their shafts together and began slowly jerking their cocks off together.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Kazuki bucked his hips, trying to ease the throbbing of arousal in his form flesh as Decro pumped his shaft. The officer, too, could feel the pure lust rise within him. He gripped both dicks harder still and began pumping faster.

        "Hnggft!" their collective moans of pleasure expressed the heights of their libido. Decro leaned forward so his cheek was touching Kazuki's, feeling the sensation of the other arctic wolf's fur against his. His warmth of life. His breaths of air.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        Kazuki put his hands on Decro's shoulders and pulled him close. Then he bit on the soft, vulnerable flesh of the soldier's neck.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "G-gahh..." Decro groaned from the mix of pain and pleasure. The sharp but warm edges biting into his flesh, dragging down his skin. Then Kazuki began licking, replacing the pangs of pain with wet strokes of pleasure. The supple flesh in his mouth as he massaged it with his tongue.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Decro shivered, almost losing his focus on their cocks. Without the suit to hold him in place, his helpless arousals were on full display for Kazuki to see. He bit his lips, nuzzling harder against Kazuki's face as he struggled to hold himself together. The arm supporting his body weight was shaking, weak from his physical exertions.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        But they were almost there. Just a few more thrusts of their hips. A few more pumps of their shafts. And...

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Kazuki's lips were suddenly met with Decro's as the latter swooped down for a kiss just as they achieved their orgasms. The engineer was surprised, but not for long, as he began reciprocating the kiss. Kazuki groaned, unloading every last drop of his seed onto his suit. Decro shot out his essence at the same time, coating the engineer's suited chest with his spunk too.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Their lips pressed against each other, and their tongues moved to an unchoreographed dance, thrusting in and out of the other wolf's mouth. Their seed mixing with each other on Kazuki's chest. And they held the kiss for a long, long time.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Only when the burning passion in their chests subsided into shimmering embers did Decro pull back and they both grinned at each other, feeling the warm afterglow.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        "So how's my suit?" Decro asked teasingly, getting off the table. The ACE exosuit closed the crotch hatch, once again concealing his manhood behind a suggestive bulge.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Looks good to me, sir," Kazuki pretended to roll his eyes, grabbing a cloth to wipe off his suit before tucking his member back into his suit and zipping it up, "You can go now."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Thanks," Decro grinned, giving the engineer a goodbye hug before turning to leave the room. Kazuki returned the smile before turning back to the panels and shutting the diagnostic display down.

        The workshop door closed with a whizz. A soft chime played as the lights turned off and the wall panels began to fade back into the black void of space. Kazuki prepared to return to his position of quiet contemplation when suddenly, two hands embraced him from behind and Decro's face appeared over his shoulder, landing a playful peck on the engineer's cheek.

        The surprise caught Kazuki off guard, but the comforting squeeze put a warm feeling in his chest. Before he realised it, a smile had appeared on his lips.
