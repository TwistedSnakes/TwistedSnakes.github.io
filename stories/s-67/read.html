        Shit. I've been...kidnapped or something. I'm not sure. I was a little tipsy when I left the bar last night, but I'm definitely sober now in the boot of my captors' car. It's dark, it's unpleasantly warm, and it's a bumpy ride.

        The ropes around my wrists and ankles did nothing to help my situation, pulling my body into a hogtie position. A cloth was stuffed into my mouth and a muzzle clamped my maw around it, making sure I couldn't call for help. But even without the gag, I'd find it difficult to call for help: my mouth is dry from alcohol dehydration, and a throbbing headache is plaguing my mind.

        I'm not sure how long I've been here. It was night when I was attacked, bound, and chucked into the boot of a getaway car, but judging by the noise of the traffic outside, it's probably daytime by now. My captors sure are taking me far away from here, which means that nobody's going to know where to look for me.

        I can hear the sounds of other cars die down. They're probably taking me down some deserted road. Not a good sign.

        An hour or so passes before the car stops. The engine turns off, the car doors open, and I hear footsteps coming around. Then the car boot opens. My eyes try to get used to the blinding light, but soon enough I catch a glimpse of my captors: a shark and a tiger.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Mfft!" I protest angrily. Deep inside, I'm really, really scared, but I can't show them that.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Fiesty one, isn't he?" the shark commented in a gruff voice with a smirk plastered across his face.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Fiesty ones are more troublesome to train," the tiger rolled his eyes, "I don't know why you still like them."

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "It's fun to break their spirits," the shark chuckled, "Strong-willed people reduced to obedient pets. Mmm..."

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        The shark picks me up and throws me effortlessly over his shoulder. As they close the boot and lock the car, I look around. As far as I can tell, I'm in a warehouse or factory of sorts. There is a high ceiling with exposed pipes and wires running across steel beams. The grimy fluorescent lights flicker on as the tiger turns on the switches in a corner of the large room. A machine, about as high as a person, sat in the centre of the room surrounded by metal cages.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        I don't like the look of this, and I'm sure to inform the shark of that as I squirm within my bonds and grumble from behind my gag, but that only elicits another chuckle from him.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The shark brings me in front of the machine, and I get a bad feeling about it. I'm tossed on the floor and I land hard on my shoulder.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The tiger joins us, cutting the ropes to my hogtie. This is my chance. I should be running free. But the impact of the fall has left me in pain and my limbs are still numb from the hours spent locked in the car. Instead, all I can manage is a groan as I try to gather strength to move my body.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Where do you think you're going?" the shark grinned, placing his foot on my chest and pinning me down. He clenched his claws, digging them into my skin. "You're not going anywhere."

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        "Hey, stop toying with him," the tiger grunted, "We have an order to fill." He walked over to the machine and pulled a handle on its side. A panel opened up, revealing a dark chamber within the machine.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Shut up," the tiger sighed back, "Just take off his clothes, chuck him in, and let the machine do its job."

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Of course," the shark takes his foot off my chest and crouches beside me. With a swift motion, he rips my shirt off me. My pants and underwear follow, leaving them tattered along with the remains of my dignity.

        He picks me up again. This time, he carries me over to the machine and shoves me unceremoniously into its chamber.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        I land on the cold metal floor with a loud clang. My shoulder hurts again, and my vision goes hazy with the pain. By the time I've come to my senses, the panel has already been closed. Banging my fists on the panel doesn't help: it had been latched from the outside, leaving me trapped in here in pitch blackness once again.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        I try and feel the space around me. The ceiling is so low I can't stand up straight. There's barely enough space for me to be on all fours, so I make do with the room I'm given.
       </span>

        But I can't do anything about it as the machine hums to life.  The shark must've turned it on. I feel humid air blow into the chamber, and suddenly something hits me on my back. My hand reaches behind to feel it, only to have my fingers grab a fistful of thick, gooey gunk.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        I try to wipe it off me, but my actions only spread the weird liquid across my back and onto my hands.

       <span class="italic">
        Ugh.
       </span>
       <span>

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        More of it is coming from the ceiling of the chamber, drenching my scales with its rubbery exterior.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "What's this?" I shout, banging again on the metal walls of the machine, "Help!" I hear a chuckle from the outside of the machine.

       <span class="italic">
        Fuck.

        The liquid seems to have a mind of its own, spreading across my body through thick, sticky tendrils. They grab and grope at my body, trying to encase every inch of exposed skin.

        "Hey, wait, no!" I try to reach around to pull it off me, but the sticky latex on my hands had adhered them to the ground. In the meantime, something round nudges against my vulnerable pucker, threatening to thrust its way in.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Sure enough, it does. "Ahh–fhgt!" a phallic shape forces itself into my mouth as I protest the rear intruder, gagging me with the foul-tasting latex. I feel the penis gag in my mouth, filling out my maw with its girthy shaft.

        The viscous liquid coats my chest and abs, spreading down my arms and legs before fixing my hands and knees onto the ground. It gradually hardens, forming a latex skin around me. The warm air blows against the rubber, causing it to shrink and warp. The latex on my arms pulls my wrists back, forcing them firmly against my shoulders so that I have to use my elbows to support the front of my body. My ankles are pulled back too, pressing my heels against my rump.

        I stumble about in the dark. My wings and tail are getting coated in the pouring latex, making them feel heavy beneath the weight of the viscous fluid. In the same way, the latex tightens, pulling my wings in so they are painfully pressed against my back.

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        At the same time, the latex in my maw spreads up my face, threatening to enter my eyes. I close my eyes tight, feeling the liquid creep over them and encase the entirety of my head, leaving only breathing holes for me to maintain consciousness.

       <span>
        It dries and tightens, pressing against my facial features without revealing how I look like inside. The pressure forces the gag deeper into my maw, and I can feel the same happen for my latex-coated rump, shoving the dildo deeper into me.

        I shuffle around in a panic, wondering what's happening to me. What's going on? Why are they subjecting me to this?

        The flow of rubber from the ceiling stops and the excess latex drips off me, leaving me behind in a sort of form-fitting suit forming my second skin. I'm like a rubber gimp trapped in a seamless bitchsuit keeping me on my fours.

        I hear the hum of the machine die down, leaving me panting in silence, scared and blind to what's going on about me. I hear the panel open, but the latex suit isn't letting me see any light whatsoever.

        I stumble towards the source of the sound, struggling to escape. But there's a click as a sort of strap is cuffed around my neck.

       Dracoshu the dragon is kidnapped and brought to a warehouse. He is stripped and thrown into a processing machine that begins turning him into a latex pet. Living liquid latex drips from the ceiling of the machine, spreading across his body and groping it. The living latex creates the form of a dildo and thrusts into his tailhole, and another one forces itself into his mouth. The latex shrinks and warps, pulling him into a bitchsuit position. His head is fully hooded, only leaving him breathing holes. His cock is encased in a chastity cage made of solid latex. Once the machine is done with him, he is leashed, collared, and taken away to his new life as a permanent pet.
