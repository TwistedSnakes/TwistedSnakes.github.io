        Jaune thought the dildo was large when it was first presented to him. It felt even bigger once it was only halfway up his tailhole with more to go. By the time it was fully within him, the black-furred fox was silently whimpering as he endured its generous girth. A pair of latex trunks was snapped into place, hilting the shaft within him.

        His cock throbbed within the tight cage that was designed like a snake’s head: the signature design of the Silver Serpent. A suit, tie, and vest completed his butler’s uniform: a fitting uniform for the Royal Tea Farm.

        “Golden peach tea, table seven,” the kitchen staff placed a silver tray onto the counter.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Upon the tray was a teapot, teacup, and saucer; all similarly crafted with gold trims in the white porcelain. More expensive still was the amber liquid within the teapot. The menu behind the counter revealed that the order alone cost three thousand dollars. It was brewed with tea leaves handpicked from the wild honey tea bush, then infused with golden peaches handpicked from the peach trees that grow alongside them. Those only grew on the treacherous cliffs of the Krowar mountains, putting them among the rarest teas in the world.

        Jaune nodded and picked up the tray. The Silver Serpent was like a second home to the wealthy patrons living a life of luxury. Their days were spent gambling at the casino tables, and their nights were spent being serviced by the bondage slaves that the casino offered.

        As he walked, the plug nudged against his sensitive insides, stimulating his member as it pressed against the cold, unyielding walls of the cage. Serving at the Royal Tea Farm café was a full-time commitment, and the cage was not coming off for another two more weeks.

        He just needed to cum. What he wouldn’t do for just one night of freedom, perhaps with a dominant partner to snuggle against. To stroke his chest, his thighs, his needy cock, before penetrating his rump with unbridled zeal.

        The sound of crashing porcelain filled the air. The result of his distraction was amber tea staining the silver carpet, porcelain shattered on the floor, and one furious customer.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        “I’m so sorry, sir!” Jaune knelt to the ground, taking the towel from his forearm and trying to absorb the tea from the tiger’s drenched cashmere pants. The feline leapt to his feet.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "I wish to see the manager," the tiger growled in a calm yet threatening way.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Of course, sir," Jaune bowed again.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Two butlers rushed over with a towel and a change of clothes, trying to appease the tiger's anger as they led him away to the nearby washrooms. Jaune stood up awkwardly, using a tablecloth to stop the dropping of the spilt tea. The vibrator in his rump started teasing him again; another customer was calling for service.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The Royal Tea farm didn't use digital call buttons or service bells to ask for their waiters. Instead, a buttplug served the purpose just as well, if not better. With just a push of a button, customers could call a butler as many times as they wanted without annoying other customers with a shrill bell. Beneath his breath, Jaune cursed whoever came up with the idea: it was effective but oh so devious.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Trying to salvage the stained fine carpet, he clenched his tailhole and ignored the buzzing. Someone else could deal with that customer. Sure, he might get chewed up by his boss later, but he was already in serious trouble anyway.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        Jaune sighed.

        "So what do you have to say for yourself?" Yen reclined in his chair behind his huge blackstone table with furrowed brows.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "I have no excuses sir," Jaune bowed, standing a metre away from the desk, "It was my mistake."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "First you spill the tea, then you ignore subsequent customer calls," the labrador retriever huffed. "And yes I saw you blatantly ignoring the next customer call after that too," he added as Jaune opened his mouth to speak.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        A heavy silence hung in the air. Jaune remained quiet, keeping his head bowed while he waited for Yen to decide on the next course of action. The canine was massaging his temples with one hand, closing his eyes deep in thought.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        A long minute passed. Finally, Yen sighed and opened his eyes again. Opening an intricately-carved wooden box on his desk, he picked a small sachet of fine tea. A teapot of warm water sat on the table. He lifted its lid and emptied the sachet's contents into it before swirling the teapot to mix the leaves. "This is your fourth fuck-up this month now," the canine said.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Jaune continued his silence. That wasn't a question, but a statement.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Tell me, Jaune, do you really want to serve?"
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Yes, of course. That's why I signed up to be a waiter–"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Okay," the canine interrupted, "You see the thing is, here at the RTF, we give the customer only the best of experiences. They pay good money for only the finest service."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Jaune nodded.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "And thus, it must only be enjoyed in the most excellent of environments. A silly café by the roadside won't do the tea justice. That's where we come in. Do you understand Jaune? Perfect is not. Good. Enough." Yen emphasized the last three words with force.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "You're obviously not competent enough to serve the tea we present to our customers," Yen continued, "Tell me, Jaune, do you really want to serve?"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Yes, sir," came the meek reply.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Very well," Yen said stoically. With an open palm, he gestured towards the pot. The tea had steeped, turning the water a deep reddish-yellow. Jaune complied with the silent command, stepping forward to pour the tea into the two porcelain cups on the desk. Each one was trimmed with gold lines along its rim and handle, seated neatly in the middle of a matching saucer. The fox filled the cups with tea and stepped back.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Yen picked up a cup and saucer with his hands. "Drink," he ordered, and Jaune did as he was told. The tea was rich, spreading across his tongue and washing over his mind. He pulled the cup away from his lips, trying to focus his wavy vision. Yen had put his cup down; not a drop of his tea was touched.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The cup and saucer fell from Jaune's hands to the ground, spilling tea everywhere. The fox's limp body followed, unconscious and vulnerable.

        Jaune awoke to the bright lights of a sterile laboratory. White panels formed its four walls, one of which had a doorway and a glass panel, both of which led into a similar room. To his surprise, he was standing atop a circular plinth, still wearing his smart tuxedo.

        He should’ve fallen over in his sleep, but for some reason, he was completely unable to move. His chest was puffed forward and his back was straight. His right hand held a silver tray with teaware positioned nicely on it; his left forearm had a towel draped over it. His head was locked in place and forced to look straight ahead.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        Jaune groaned. It wasn’t the question he was asking, but it was as he feared: he was in the processing labs of the Silver Serpent. He had never seen it before, but he had heard stories of gamblers who bit off more than they can chew. To pay off their debts, they were dragged. kicking and screaming, into the restricted areas of the Silver Serpent. A trip to the white rooms, and out comes a black, latex drone.

        Rai grinned. He stroked the black, silky pants that Jaune wore, and the fox could feel a metal rod press against his skin.

        “A metal frame to hold you in place,” Rai explained. “Spent almost the entire day working on this. It’s like a full-body cage, but it’s invisible beneath your fur.”

        The jolteon slid a finger up the fox’s neck, allowing Jaune to feel the metal frame that held his neck and jaw in place.

        Rai left through the doorway, which materialised into a solid panel. Jaune could see the jolteon through the glass panel as he made his way to a control panel.

        The jolteon tapped on the control panel and a buzzing started in Jaune’s rump. The fox winced and instinctively tried to expel the plug, but the latex trunks only forced it back into him, where it grinded against his prostate again.

        His cock throbbed in its metal encasement, pressed firmly against his crotch by the latex, forming a sizable bulge within his pants. He was concerned about his fate, but the incessant stimulation was making it hard to focus.

        The dildo was pulsing against his innermost recesses, massaging his insides.

        A mist began filling the glass chamber from the ceiling. The liquid particles clung to his fur, gradually coating him with the clear fluids. Jaune trembled. His legs felt like buckling beneath him from the surges of quivering euphoria from inside, but the metal frame supported him.

        His eyes darted around the laboratory, trying to signal to Rai for help. The jolteon, however, ignored his silent pleas. Jaune’s tuxedo was slowly soaking up the liquid too, and some of it seeped onto his fur. A stiffness began to settle over his body where the liquid had come in contact with his skin.

        His eyes could no longer move as it stuck looking straight ahead. His body quivered, encased within the solidifying tuxedo. The latex trunks hugged his crotch tightly, keeping the dildo in his stretched and sore tailhole, and the chastity cage in its smooth latex bulge.
