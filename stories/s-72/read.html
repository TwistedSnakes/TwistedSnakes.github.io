He gathers the courage to ask the snake out for lunch, and then to be his master. To his relief, Sephos agrees. Sephos brings the shark up to his room and makes him sign a slave contract. He then hypnotises Dolfengra, bringing him into a trance and out again. After that, he penetrates the shark\u2019s rear. Sephos puts the shark\u2019s cock in a chastity sleeve, tucks it back into the shark\u2019s genital slit, and then slit-fucks with his two cocks. He also fucks Dolfengra\u2019s rear with his tail, and thrusts his tongue into the shark\u2019s mouth. He brings Dolfengra back into a trance and cums into his slit. Sephos then orders Dolfengra to put on a full latex suit before welding a collar onto the shark.

Unfortunately for the duo, they don't get along well. After braving through the treacherous swamp that surrounds the ancient temple, they attempt to solve the various puzzles that guard the treasure within, all the while trying to sabotage each other's efforts in reaching the treasure.\nEventually, they split up, but they each fall for the traps in their respective chambers and end up kidnapped by an alligator named Graku.\nGraku suspends Orion upside down from the ceiling with black goo, and chains Crestor to a rack. Using the living goo to stimulate both his victims, Graku positions them so that Orion and Crestor are forced to give each other fellatio. He swings the suspended naga's body so that their cocks are thrust into each other's mouths.\nHours later, Graku injects a liquid into Crestor and Orion that paralyzes them. He poses them, mummify them with bandages, and coats them in a layer of resin that gives them the appearance of stone statues.\nSoon enough, they're positioned outside the temple as a dragon and naga statue respectively, standing guard on either sides of the temple's entrance. Black gems are stuck over their eyes so that there's no way of telling that anyone was in the statues. They are almost recognized by four adventurers from their guild who are there on a dungeon raid, but no luck. Crestor and Orion would be there for years to come.",

Unfortunately for the duo, they don't get along well. After braving through the treacherous swamp that surrounds the ancient temple, they attempt to solve the various puzzles that guard the treasure within, all the while trying to sabotage each other's efforts in reaching the treasure.\nEventually, they split up, but they each fall for the traps in their respective chambers and end up kidnapped by an alligator named Graku.\nGraku suspends Orion upside down from the ceiling with black goo, and chains Crestor to a rack. Using the living goo to stimulate both his victims, Graku positions them so that Orion and Crestor are forced to give each other fellatio. He swings the suspended naga's body so that their cocks are thrust into each other's mouths.\nHours later, Graku injects a liquid into Crestor and Orion that paralyzes them. He poses them, mummify them with bandages, and coats them in a layer of resin that gives them the appearance of stone statues.\nSoon enough, they're positioned outside the temple as a dragon and naga statue respectively, standing guard on either sides of the temple's entrance. Black gems are stuck over their eyes so that there's no way of telling that anyone was in the statues. But when four adventurers from their guild are there on a dungeon raid, they find and free Crestor and Orion, and the six of them make their way home.",

        "summary": "Out of curiosity, Crestor, Dendar, Garret, Niall, Nikoli, and Seglagg sneak into the King's Carnival at night. After they use the main control panel to power the entire carnival, they split up to have fun. However, unbeknownst to them, the owner of the carnival, a shark, is still lurking in the shadows.\nOne by one, the shark begins to kidnap the six trespassers. First, Dendar the naga is captured, restrained and bound as the figurehead of a ship which would be used in a boat ride attraction. Seglagg the lizard is bound in a display box as a mechanical fortune teller as the metal frame moves his arms. Nikoli the snow leopard has his cock caged in a chastity device which is glued shut. Leather cuffs are glued on his wrists and ankles, followed by leather trunks and a face mask. A shower of wax turns him into a wax statue.\nThe shark tortures Niall the hyena by sending electrical currents through his body piercings, then glued between two rubber sheets as if he were in a vacbed, and set up as a squirming exhibit in the House of Horrors. Garret the wolf is mummified in plastic wrap and tape, and put in an inflatable target in a life-sized Whack-a-Mole game. Metal is welded around Crestor the dragon and he's painted silver, making him a flying dragon that's mounted on the carousel.\nThe park is opened again the next day, presenting the six new trespassers-turned-attractions who will be there for a long time to come.",

        "summary": "Dexter the wolf is a socially-awkward student who keeps to himself. He's friends with Chris, a charismatic and confident sergal who hangs out with him to study. On the way home from school one day, Dexter finds a draconic mask on the pavement, which he brings home. Once home, he puts the mask on, only to find himself getting incredibly aroused. Filled with a raw sense of strength, he jacks himself off, and he falls asleep on his bed as he drips the last of his cum.\nThe next day, Chris comes over to Dexter's place to study. On the way to the toilet, a deep voice called for Dexter, explaining that he was responsible for the wolf's arousal from the day before, and that he can help him feel the same strength again. Convinced, Dexter puts the mask on. Feeling the same confidence as before, he instructs Chris to come into the room where he teases and fucks the sergal, calling him a slut.\nDays later, Dexter finds himself at a party with Chris. He brings his mask over and wears it, allowing the confidence to return. He invites Kagi the husky to fuck, and they do it in full view of everyone on the couch. Chris comes over expectantly and Dexter teases him, only to lock the sergal's cock in a cage before he can cum. Dexter then invites another party-goer over for more sex.\nUnder the influence of the mask, Dexter goes into a strip club. He interrupts a tiger stripper that was servicing another client, and instructs the stripper to suck him off. Instead of paying the tiger, he convinces the tiger to pay him for access to his cock. He then fucks the tiger on the couch, at the cost of more money out of the tiger's pocket.\nA week later, Dexter is relaxing at home. He tries to jack off, but he can't seem to reach orgasm. The mask offers to help, and Dexter puts it on. However, the mask releases a gush of goo which coats Dexter's body. He struggles to escape, but his air supply is cut. His cock is stimulated, a cock gag is forcefully shoved into his mouth, and a dildo is shoved up his tailhole. His dick is encased in a null bulge, and his body is taken over by the mask. His body is turned into that of the dragon Teryx. Teryx, now in control of the draconic body, releases his cock from the null bulge and jacks off. He then flushes Chris' chastity key down the toilet before disappearing into the city.",

After some teasing as Ibrahim blows his load into the suit, they fall asleep. When Ibrahim wakes up, Zasko binds Ibrahim with leather straps, restraining his forearm to his upper arm and his ankles against his rump. This forces Ibrahim to walk on his elbows and knees, which are put in latex sleeves with hooves on their ends. A ball gag is shoved into the Ibrahim's mouth, and a realistic horse mask replaces the previous one. This one has dark lenses for eyes and a canid dildo gag, making him neigh like a horse whenever Ibrahim whines. Plastic breathing tubes are pushed into his nostrils, making the neighing more realistic. Zasko then uses anal plug with a horse tail end to fuck Ibrahim before lodging in his ass and zipping it into the suit. The suit is then sealed permanently with glue, and Zasko brings Ibrahim to the furry convention they had planned.",

He acts on that impulse and goes. Despite having been abandoned years ago, the glass doors to the office building opens up to him anyway.\nFollowing Negadrake's instructions, he tries to make his way up to the roof of the building. However, strange occurrences happen within the tower, so James is relieved to finally reach the roof. Negadrake isn't there, but he finds a mysterious box that coats in him liquid latex that turns him into a Zekrom. The suit plugs him with an anal plug, and it begins speaking into his mind.\nThe suit reveals that it wants James to let it take over his Zekrom form, gagging and punishing him with electrostimulation and forced milking when he resists. Eventually, James gives in and orgasms, allowing the suit to take over his mind and body.",

Wreath instead turns to injecting him with the truth serum that the research lab is developing.\nThe serum injected would be more effective if Decro were sexually aroused, so Wreath tortures his nipples with metal clips. She smothers him with her breasts, forcing him to nuzzle and lick them. After that, she tips over Decro's chair and lowers her vagina over him, forcing him to service her womanhood. Finally, she puts him upright again, gags him, and and fucks herself on Decro's erect dick, enjoying the process of breaking the wolf down.\nThey orgasm, leaving the wolf too exhausted and broken to resist the serum.

He racks up over nineteen billion in debt, which he's forced to pay back through service for the casino as a drone.\nNareth wakes up restrained on a table, and is plugged with a steel anal bulb. A cleaning solution is forced down his throat, clearing out his digestive system before draining out through the plug. A feeding tube goes into his mouth and a cock tube is secured over his dick. He's then bound spreadeagle and kept in storage.\nDays later, Nareth is transferred to processing. His fur is permanently dissolved with chemicals, his antlers are sawed off, and a metal frame with an in-built ring gag is welded around his head. A gas mask with a tube gag is stretched around his head and melted in place, allowing him only to make feral deer-like noises. His manhood is sealed in a rubber null bulge, and a plug is filled in his tailhole. His chest is then branded with a laser beam. His wrists and ankles are chopped off, replaced with rubber hooves that are melted over his stumps. His antlers are replaced with antler-like antennae as they are drilled into his skull, then his body is coated with latex. His latex skin is painted to look like the fur markings of who he used to be. Finally, he's brainwashed into a rubber drone.\nIn a hotel room, a horse calls for a rubber drone, and Nareth is assigned to him. The deer drone is forced to suck the horse off, receiving electric shocks whenever he tries to resist. When he gives in, however, he's rewarded with vibrations in his null bulge and anal plug, although he'll never be able to cum in his chastity. When the horse cums, he's forced to swallow it all.\nSlowly but surely, Nareth would eventually be no more than a fully-obedient deer drone.",

He wakes up in a glass pod that his company designed. This glass pod is meant to store people for long periods of time.\nHe's dressed in a skintight suit that encases the entirety of his body up to his neck, where a metal collar locks it in place. A tube built into his suit's anal is secured over his sphincter, keeping his tailhole open. His cock and balls are stored in a bulge pouch in the front of his suit. The tank is filled with a blue liquid and Decro is forced to put on a helmet that would give him oxygen to breathe. A dildo gag is forced into his mouth.\nMetal tentacles restrain him, slotting his limbs into clamps in the wall that hold him in place. A dildo-tipped tentacle plugs deeply in his tailhole, locks in place, and begin stimulating him with vibrations. A milking tube is secured over his cock, and he's repeatedly forced to orgasm. His helmet begins brainwashing him until he's no more than a cum slave.",

This time, the suit comes to life, extending wires that grab Auro and pull him into the suit. A spinal attachment links him up to the suit, and a dildo is knotted in his rump. Another dildo is forced into his mouth, gagging him inside of the suit. The suit will allow him to work 24/7 now, increasing his efficiency. The suit also uses the spinal attachment to control Auro's body, further increasing the amount of work he can do. Completing tasks will also reward him with an orgasm, which force-feeds his seed back to him.\nBut the prolonged use of the exosuit slowly wipes Auro's mind, until he's no more than a service drone in the Silver Serpent.",

Food is fed to him through a phallus that forces him to take it down the throat before it pumps nutritional fluids into him. An electronic collar disables his vocal chords, making it impossible for him to plead his innocence to the heartless guards.\nHe's taken to the processing room where his arms, legs, and tail are amputated. The wounds are cauterized and metal discs, each with a ring on their ends, are screwed into the ends of the severed bones. His vocal cords are removed, rendering him permanently mute. A catheter is inserted all the way into his bladder, and a metal probe is lodged in his tailhole. Both these devices are trapped within him with a chastity belt.\nDays later, Decro is brought to another room and his limbless body is mounted on a pole. A muzzle with an inbuilt tube gag is forced over his head, and dark lenses are glued over his eyes. Latex is molded over Decro's head to form a hood, and his form is chained up to a base and overhead structure through the rings on Decro's amputated stumps. Tubes connect to Decro's muzzle and chastity device to clean him out and provide him with his life support. Aphrodisiacs keep him horny for life. He's brought to the prison lobby where he's put on display as a warning to others against breaking the law.",

After his chastity is released, he is blindfolded, collared, leashed, and teased. However, Kyrie is interrupted by urgent matters that she is forced to attend to, leaving Zephyrius there.\nWhile Zephyrius waits for Kyrie's return, an unknown intruder, a lion, comes in to harass the jackal. He forces a ring gag in Zephyrius' mouth, ties him up, and whips him. The lion proceeds to rim him and play with his balls. After that, he fingers Zephyrius before fucking him to the point of orgasm. Zephyrius' tailhole is then plugged by an oversized knotted dildo to keep the cum in.\nHowever, the lion wasn't done. The jackal is forced to clean up the lion's cock with his tongue, only to be forced to suck the lion off to orgasm again. The lion then removed Zephyrius' anal plug and fucks the hole, again to orgasm. He then pisses in the jackal's mouth, forcing him to swallow when the lion blocks his nose. Lastly, the lion pisses all over the jackal and kidnaps him.\nZephurius finds himself taken and thrown into the palace pools, where, with his blindfold removed, he realizes the lion was a friend of his, Caelan.  They relax in the pool until Kyrie comes back, locking Zephyrius in another six months of chastity without letting him orgasm.",

        "summary": "After Soul the dragon, with his Riolu defeats another Pokémon trainer, they nap in the grassy plains. However, Soul wakes up to Riolu turning him into a latex Riolu with a ball of goo. Riolu controls Soul's latex suit, making it muzzle Soul when he talks back. The Riolu, named Rio, teases Soul but does not let him orgasm by forming a cock ring in the suit.\nThe suit's muzzle turns into a tube gag and Rio forces Soul to suck him off. A dildo in the suit plugs him in the ass for encouragement. Rio fucks Soul's mouth to orgasm, and the latex around Soul's mouth closes up and forces him to swallow the cum. The latex anal plug shifts into a hollow one, and Rio fucks Soul's virgin tailhole. After his orgasm, the latex shifts back into a dildo, keeping the cum in.\nRio then teases Soul, saying that if he can cum in five minutes, he'll let him go. But the cock ring stops Soul from cumming before time is up, and Rio uses a latex Pokéball to capture Soul. The ball forces Soul in a curled-up position with his dick in his mouth. Desperate to cum, he's forced to suck his rubber dick, tasting pre but with no way to cum.",

Clemos is put spreadeagle and plugged with an inflatable, hollow butt plug. He's unwillingly stimulated and his cock is glued in a hollow dildo, turning it into a useless toy. Clemos is then glued in a latex suit and a gas mask with a dildo gag.\nHowever, Draco betrays Shu, plugging him with another inflatable butt plug and a dildo gag. Shu's manhood is locked in a chastity plate that's glued inside his slit, and he's glued in a latex suit and gas mask. Shu is then locked in a chastity belt as it is welded in place. The both dragons are sealed up in vacbeds and fed a strong aphrodisiac that brainwashes them.\nThe two new slaves are sold to a nightclub where Clemos is forced to fuck Shu's tailhole on stage, although their \"attachments\" deny them their much-desired orgasms. The gas mask feeds them the aphrodisiac, keeping them permanently enslaved.",

He goes in to find his suspicions correct: the Silver Serpent is turning people into service drones. However, he gets kidnapped. A rubber mask with a tube gag is forced over him, and a latex sleeve is glued over his dick. A chastity plate secures his rubber cock in his slit. A vibrator within teases him to orgasm. He's then suited in a latex suit, strapped in a straitjacket, and dildo-tipped tubes plug his mouth and ass. Electrical shocks keep his muscles stimulated as he's kept in a storage sleepsack, ruthlessly teased for six months.\nAvon is then released from his straitjacket, forced into a metal frame that keeps him on all fours like a feral animal, and locked in place. A blindfold stops him from seeing as he is set up as a public fucktoy. He gets penetrated from both ends, unable to orgasm with his chastity plate. Between breaks, he is fed a nutrient solution through a dildo that's pushed into his mouth.\nA month later, after being an unsatisfactory slut, he is released from his frame and his head is encased in an airtightvlatex hood that keeps his mouth open, but seals his nostrils close. He's suited in a fullbody latex suit and once again restrained in a straitjacket and sleepsack.\nThe pipe from an above urinal is secured to his mouth and the teasing in his slit vibrato begins again. He's forced to drink piss if he wants to breathe.\nMeanwhile, a government official is talking to Decro, the owner of the Silver Serpent. It is revealed that Decro sponsors the state, and the government is afraid that Avon's actions have caused a tension between them. Decro, however, accepts the official's apology. The official offers to allow the Silver Serpent to keep Avon, and they leave him as a permanent urinal.",

His jockstrap is shoved into his maw, gagging him, and his sweaty shirt is used on him as a blindfold. The students prop Decro up on the bench and they begin sexually teasing him. Raiko locks Decro's cock in a chastity cage and teases it while Triden fucks Decro's virgin tailhole. The three of them take turns to use Decro as their fuck toy before leaving him there for night.\nBefore the night is over, however, the janitor finds him.

He meets another separated soldier from the opposing army: a Dralic named Nalani.\nThey do not trust each other at first, but as they work together to survive, they start to bond.

Storm insists it is necessary, and he leaves.\nFive years after the war, the two are finally reunited.",

Dying in the game would lead to the death of their physical body.\nAs they try to escape, members of the team fall one by one to various traps, until only Decro is left behind. After training to a high level, he confronts the end-game wyrm. He tries to defeat it, but it coats him with latex and turns him into a robot in a suit of metal armour. His mechanical mind is wiped of his memories, leaving behind a robotic guardian to serve the wyrm.",

        "summary": "Flint, after owing Kyngios a lot of money, is forced to be his pup for a month. Kyngios makes him suit up in latex and restrains him so that he's forced to walk on his knees and elbows. A rubber canine mask with dark lenses for eyes and a tube gag is forced over his head, and a collar is locked around his neck, securing the suit onto him. Kyngios then hypnotises Flint, turning him into an obedient pup before fucking his mouth and making him swallow his cum.\nWarren, to repay his debts, is bound to a metal bench. Latex tape is wrapped around his body before a huge machine melts the latex on. Resin hardens around him, and more layers of latex and resin are added over him. A hollow plug keeps his tailhole open, while his cock is left permanently erect. Seti then plugs his mouth and tailhole up with dildos, tape Warren's nose so that he can't breathe, and proceeds to fuck himself on the canine's cock. The dog-turned-bench is then put in the Silver Serpent lounge for guests to break into.\nSky is kept in chastity with a tight cock ring, flattened, and laminated between two sheets of plastic. He's mounted on one of the casino's walls, allowing guests to tease him without ever letting him cum.\nRombus is bound to a person-sized butt plug and a thick layer of resin is sprayed over him. A macro dragon, who Rombus lost a bet to, uses Rombus to fuck him in the ass, only to leave the butt plug lodged in his ass.\nVuul hypnotises Negadrake, turning him into an obedient slave. Negadrake willingly fucks himself on Vuul, while Vuul coats him with goo, turning him into a faceless, latex, dragon drone.\nMorsh finds his limbs stashed away with portal rings, and his limbless body is put into a rubber suit and sealed. He is then used as a pillow.",

He wakes up on an operating table. His arms, legs, wings, and tail are amputated and replaced with metal stumps. He is then suspended by chains to a metal frame.\nThe frame is wheeled into the lab containing the monster, and it begins wrapping its tentacles around his body. His sheath is stimulated, his balls are massaged, and another tentacle penetrates his tailhole.\nMeanwhile, a tentacle forces itself down his throat and into his stomach, pumping latex eggs into his body. More eggs are forced up his tailhole, nudging against his prostate. Once it was done, it plugged Cobra's tailhole with an anal plug.\nCobra is then put into a storage pod with one tube on his mouth, and another on his cock. The pod begins milking him, only to feed him with his own cum. The entire pod is then filled with more latex.\nMonths later, Cobra is brought out. The eggs hatch within him, releasing living latex which engulf and take over his body. Tests are then conducted on him.\nAfter many more months of testing, he's freed from the latex.

The entire device is glued, permanently securing Duga's dick. The arcanine is then coated with solid resin, posed on his fours, and left to stand for the night.\nThe next day, the resin in Duga's mouth and tailhole is melted and shaped into hollow tubes with dildos, pushing resin down his throat and up his ass. He is then put into a chamber and gas is pumped in, setting the resin permanently. He is then brought out to be fucked from both ends by the school's rugby team.",

However, Rex uses the electrodes to shock and incapacitate the wolf before tying him up and suspending him upside down. He rips Decro's underwear off, blindfolds him, and lodges a vibrating butt plug in his ass. A cock tube is attached to his cock, and a tube from it is secured to his mouth with a muzzle. He is then left in the gym to be repeatedly milked and fed his own cum.",

The machine puts him on all fours, coats him with latex, and begins suiting him up with armour plates.\nHe gets aroused, but his restraints prevent him from touching himself. His crotch is encased in an armour plate, an anal plug is inserted into his ass, and a gas mask with an inbuilt dildo is sealed around his head.\nWhen he tries to escape, however, he realizes the suit is out of battery. It begins milking him for his cum in order to power itself. However, it does not stop after the first orgasm, making Gale fight back. The suit detects his resistance, so it immobilizes him, feeds him an aphrodisiac, and begins hypnotizing him. The suit, with a brainwashed Gale still trapped inside, then walks back into its original post in the centre of the room and continues milking him.",

He is bound to a bench, teased to erection, and a cock ring keeps his cock up. He is vacuum packed by a latex sack, and heating elements melt the latex onto him. Only a tube in his mouth lets him breathe. This process was repeated until Cloud is reduced to a faceless bench with his cock erect.\nCloud's bench-bound latex body is brought to the Silver Serpent lounges for the guests to make use of. A female naga, Kamelia, plays with him by cutting off his air supply when she covers the tube. She then abuses his inability to orgasm by jacking him off. After that, she puts Cloud upright and fucks herself on his dick. After she orgasms, she smears her ejaculate over his face before leaving him to other patrons of the casino. ",

Over time, however, he starts to get comfortable there: he learns how to excel at gambling games, makes friends with other proficient gamblers, and gains a newfound sense of confidence.\nOne day, after fucking a latex drone, Wiki finds himself curious about the drone's serene mindlessness and asks to be taken to where the drones are made. He is taken to Decro, the owner of the Silver Serpent, who offers to show him new levels of strength. Wiki agrees, and dark tendrils burst forth from Decro, restrain Wiki, and begin fucking his tailhole and milking his cock. Latex is spread over him, turning him into a demonic dragon.",

        "summary": "Wiki, now under the Silver Serpent's corruption, searches for his next prey. He spots a grygon by the name of Charrtar, and challenges his sexual dominance. This leads them to have sex on a lounge couch with Charrtar fucking Wiki. However, Wiki took on his demonic form, and when Charrtar orgasms, he pulls the grygon in for a kiss, and begins coating him with latex. The latex forms a latex suit with a gas mask, which begins sedating Charrtar with a brainwashing gas, turning the grygon into a submissive drone.\nAfter the encounter, Wiki feels the hunger within him growing. He confronts Decro about it. Decro instructs Wiki to stand in the middle of a large device, which restrains him with steel tentacles. A neural connector is pierced into the back of Wiki's head and spine, pumping him with a cool liquid. The neural connector fills his mind with data from the Silver Serpent. He then realizes that this has been the plan all along: he had been hypnotized by a Silver Serpent advertisement, and slowly corrupted over his time here.\nHe struggles to escape, but the transformation begins, painfully turning him into a robotic dragon. His mind is then reprogrammed, turning him into an obedient dragon drone.",

Decro is made to strip down to his tight trunks and get into a box in front of an audience of thousands. However, to his surprise and shock, he's muzzled with a tube gag and the lid of the box is latched, turning him into a cube. He's kept hydrated with the tube while he's stuck in sensory deprivation.\nHe's kept in there for twenty-four hours, but after that, Kuro coerces him to get into smaller and smaller boxes, staying for increasing durations of time. His cock is secured in a tube to clear his liquid waste, and a gas mask with a tube gag replaces the muzzle. Two vibrators, one strapped onto his cock and one plugged in his tailhole, are controlled by the stream's donators to tease him.\nWhen Decro is forced into the smallest box several months later, the box is so small that the walls of the box have to be tightened around him. He's forced to endure the pain as his body is compressed. His mouth and tailhole lead to holes on opposite side of the cube, and his cock is left sticking out one side, glued in a rubber sheath. Draco and Kyngios, two big donors to Kuro's stream, are invited to fuck the cube's holes, spit-roasting the wolf inside. All the while, Kuro teases the captive's latex cock, occasionally denying him his orgasm. Only when the tops have climaxed into Decro's holes is he allowed to cum himself. Fang, the biggest donor then receives the cube, with Decro in it, as a reward. He plugs both of the cube's holes, encases the rubber cock in a null bulge, before taking the fucktoy home.",

        "summary": "The Depraved Gamble is a show where victims are subjected to various forms of tortures: some very extreme, some very damaging, all very much unwilling. Decro and Kyuurin, both viewers of the show, are invited to watch as VIPs. Little did the wolf and gryphon know that they were selected as the show's next victims. Kahryl and Klave, two sadistic dragons, are in charge of handling the two. Kyuurin is bound to a wall to hold him in place, with a blindfold and a tape gag to occupy him. Decro is stripped and teased, with Klave frotting him almost to orgasm. However, a mechanised cockring is secured around his cock, stopping him from climaxing. Then liquid bronze is sprayed over him, encasing parts of him in metal. At the same time, Kahryl fucks the wolf in the ass, cumming inside him. Only then does Klave let the wolf orgasm, only to make it his last as he turns the canine's cock into bronze too. The rest of Decro is covered in bronze, only to watch the world outside through bronze-tinted lenses with his mouth and tailhole open and vulnerable for fucking. Kyuurin's torture then follows.\nA park would later on find two statues, a wolf and a gryphon, put on display as a new attraction. The gryphon's statue is extremely fun to tease and grope with a chastity device and an anal plug keeping it horny, and the wolf statue's two ends are perfect for non-stop fucking. And they would be there for a very long time.",

        "summary": "Omen the stag approaches Laguna the badger to get to know him better. They bond over drinks, finding out that they both enjoy chastity. Laguna brings Omen to the room and introduces a chastity device that would work with Omen's genital slit. The device would spread open, lodging itself within the submissive's slit, and only a specially-shaped rod would retract its extended edges.\nLaguna then teases Omen, starting with caressing and nuzzling followed by grinding his bulge against the stag's slit. He then forces Omen to perform fellatio on him before proceeding to fuck him in the slit, allowing their cocks to grind against each other. But before Omen can cum, Laguna stops and coaxes the stag's penis out of his slit and proceed to sound it. He jacks off the stag's cock before tucking it back into the slit. The chastity device is placed in Omen's slit and locked in place, albeit with whimpers of pain from the stag. Laguna unsuccessfully attempts to fuck Omen's locked slit and calls it useless before moving on to fuck the stag's tailhole. They both orgasm, with Laguna cumming in Omen's tailhole, and Omen cumming into his slit and leaking his cum everywhere.\nHowever, when Omen asks to be unlocked, Laguna reveals that the sounding rod was actually the chastity device's key, meaning that it would be impossible to take off. The badger then kicks Omen out into the hotel corridor naked, leaving him to run away in embarrassment.",

He gives fellatio to the snake, and the snake then fucks him, turning him into the serpent’s hemipenes. Sephos then subjects himself to a bondage sequence that Zooks had prepared beforehand, which tortures the snake with electro and fucks him with a dildo. The room is exposed to the rest of the city as a sort of exhibition for Sephos. All this proves to be too much for Sephos, who breaks. Only after orgasming is he released and allowed to recover. Sephos turns Zooks back into a dragon, they make up, and shower together. However, it is revealed that Zooks’ consciousness had been split into the serpent’s two cocks, but only one was turned back. The other is left stuck as Sephos’ cock, slowly losing his identity as his mind turns into an obedient cock.",

He releases the otter, not knowing that Furx, the owner of the exhibition, intended to prepare the otter’s body as an exhibit. Furx decides to use Decro for the exhibit instead.\nFurx injects Decro with a paralysing agent. He puts the wolf’s brain on life support while he drains the blood in the rest of his body, replacing it with preservatives. He then skins the wolf and soaks him in acid to dissolve fat tissues. He then prepares Decro’s body: half of the wolf’s body is stripped of flesh, leaving only a skeletal structure. The other half is left as muscular flesh. Half of his rib cage is sawed open and his lungs, heart, and digestive system were dissected, revealing their cross-sectional structure. His jaw is similarly sawed in half and stripped to the bone. An eyeball is removed and the eye socket is scraped clean, revealing the brain inside, which Furx encases in resin. One of his testicles is dissected and opened up, and his penis is cut into two. Furx then gets the unwitting Zephyrius, a new assistant to the exhibition, to help cure the wolf’s body, hardening the resin so it could be put on display.",

Finally, Jarin is suspended in a computer-controlled gel that restrains his limbs behind him. Decro fits a hypnosis visor and a dildo-gagged mask on Jarin. He then sends the otter into storage, where the dronification track would turn him into a drone over the course of three months.\nMonths later, Evaris, the owner of the Fortune Smiles Club, comes to the Silver Serpent to investigate.

However, as she is distracted, the vibrator causes her to drop her tray of tea on a customer. Her manager, Yen, reprimands her before knocking Jaune out with sedatives. Jaune wakes up to find herself in the processing laboratories of the Silver Serpent, restrained in a standing position by Rai. Still in her dress, resin is sprayed over her, turning her into a statue. The vibrator and chastity keeps her aroused and frustrated. Shee is then put on display in the Silver Serpent as a permanent, living statue.",
