He gathers the courage to ask the snake out for lunch, and then to be his master. To his relief, Sephos agrees. Sephos brings the shark up to his room and makes him sign a slave contract. He then hypnotises Dolfengra, bringing him into a trance and out again. After that, he penetrates the shark\u2019s rear. Sephos puts the shark\u2019s cock in a chastity sleeve, tucks it back into the shark\u2019s genital slit, and then slit-fucks with his two cocks. He also fucks Dolfengra\u2019s rear with his tail, and thrusts his tongue into the shark\u2019s mouth. He brings Dolfengra back into a trance and cums into his slit. Sephos then orders Dolfengra to put on a full latex suit before welding a collar onto the shark. The shark is granted a brief moment of lucidity to realise his fate before Sephos brings him into a trance permanently.", "commissioners": ["Dolfengra"], "authors": ["TwistedSnakes"], "illustrators": [], "tags": ["adhesive", "anal penetration", "bad end", "bottom", "brainwash", "character - Dolfengra (Dolfengra)", "character - Sephos (TwistedSnakes)", "chastity", "collar", "cum swallowing", "dominant", "dominant/submissive", "forced", "gay", "hemipenis", "hypnosis", "hypnotised", "identity loss", "kissing", "latex", "latex suit", "male", "male/male", "master", "master/slave", "metal", "mind control", "multiple penetrations", "musk", "non-consent", "null bulge", "orgasm", "orgasm denial", "permanent", "point of view - third person", "questionable consent", "setting - Silver Serpent", "sex", "slave", "slit fuck", "species - shark", "species - snake", "stimulation", "submissive", "suit", "top", "top/bottom", "victim", "villain", "villain/victim", "weld"], "display_tags": ["Setting - Silver Serpent", "Male/male", "Master - Male snake", "Slave - Male shark", "Musk", "Hypnosis", "Slit fucking", "Multiple penetrations", "Cum swallowing", "Glued in latex suit", "Permanent collar", "Questionable consent", "Non-consent", "Permanent", "Bad end"], "data": {"furaffinity_upload_url": "https://www.furaffinity.net/view/36222976/", "sofurry_upload_url": "https://www.sofurry.com/view/1575011", "deviantart_upload_url": "http://fav.me/ddwhh64", "furaffinity_tags": ["hypnosis", "brainwash", "trigger", "word", "gay", "male", "top", "bottom", "dom", "sub", "master", "slave", "musk", "kiss", "slitfuck", "slit_fuck", "chastity", "orgasmdenial", "latex", "suit", "glue", "adhesive", "nullbulge", "null_bulge", "collar", "permament", "forced", "noncon", "nonconsent", "dubcon", "silver", "serpent", "silverserpent"]}, "is_listed": true};

        Like the snake he was, he slithered into Dolfengra’s mind and found a place in his heart. The shark closed his eyes and tried to clear his mind. He needed to stop thinking about the snake.

        There was no way Dolfengra could focus, not with the snake plaguing his soul. He didn’t even know his name. The thresher shark got out of the water and grabbed a towel. The bubbling jacuzzi was built in the middle of his hotel suite’s living room. A chandelier hung high above it, illuminating the room with soft white-blue tones.

        Pool water dripped onto the cool marble floor as he dried himself off. Today he would continue the rest of his one-week holiday in the Silver Serpent Casino. He would gamble to his heart’s content. Perhaps some poker, followed by roulette, then finish it up with the slot machines. That sounded fun.

        There would be no unwanted thoughts of a certain charismatic snake. He wouldn’t be keeping an eye out for him, nor would he be watching him from afar. There’d just be him, his holiday, and nobody else.

        Dolfengra’s heart thumped in his chest. Except for the classical muzak playing softly in the background, the elevator was quiet. Yet it felt like his heart was shattering the peace with each beat.

        The shark was dressed in his usual tuxedo, but the silver silk handkerchief in his breast-pocket was a new addition. He clenched his fist. If he saw the snake today, he’d approach him. For real this time.
       </span>

        The doors opened with a chime, and the shark made for the gambling halls. Poker. He’d play poker. Who knows, perhaps the snake had already left the Silver Serpent. He sighed. At least he could focus on his game, right?
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Apparently not, as Dolfengra lost for the ninth time in a row. There was no way he could focus. He threw his cards on the table and got up to leave.

        There was the sound of squeaking latex walking away, and a fourth player joined the table. Out of the corner of his eyes, the shark could see the smooth, shiny scales of a black snake. As Dolfengra sat back down, he peeked to the side. The blue stripes on the serpent’s wrists confirmed his suspicions.

        The holographic display in front of Dolfengra showed a hundred dollars deducted from his membership card for the small blind. Cards were dealt. Dolfengra lifted the corners of the two cards in front of him and peeked at their numbers.

        Should he sneak a peek at the snake? Would that be weird? But to purposely avoid looking at him would be weird too.

        As casually as he could, he turned to the snake who looked back at him. A fluttering feeling gripped Dolfengra’s heart.

        Another three hundred was deducted from his membership card. Betting had escalated quickly. The snake called too. The tiger dealt the fold: seven of diamonds, ace of spades, and king of hearts. Nothing good so far.

        Not that he’d mind. The snake must’ve been amazing at poker, with his cool, collected, and dreamy demeanour; there was no way to read his expression. The shark wasn’t as skilful at hiding his reaction. He struggled with keeping a poker face when his cards weren’t cooperating with him; much less manage to look as suave as the snake was doing.

        It must’ve been a valid action as the dealer nodded. More money drained from his membership card. He should pay attention to the game. Right. Focus. The betting continued.

        The snake’s voice was deep and smooth as he called the bet. What did he do for a living? Dolfengra guessed a voiceover artist, or maybe even a celebrity actor. With looks like that, the snake could get a job almost anywhere.

        The game! The five of hearts had been dealt while he was distracted. At least he was following the bets now. So what hand could he make from the cards? Ace and nine of spades, six of clubs, seven of diamonds, five and king of hearts. Not even a pair.

        Dolfengra gulped. He could’ve sworn the snake was glancing at him when he said it. He had a five, six, seven, and nine. But there was no eight.

        Dolfengra hoped he wouldn’t regret this later. His shirt was getting damp with his sweat. Money wasn’t an issue, but he’d be making a fool of himself if he lost. The snake would be laughing at him for being so gullible. He wanted to

The entire time, the shark kept looking at the snake between his turns. The serpent was everything he imagined he’d be, and more. The snake was gentlemanly, mixed with an underlying aura of confidence. Dolfengra blushed.

        Dolfengra nodded. The Silver Serpent had so many strips of shops, restaurants, and bars, choosing where to eat was a difficult task. It didn’t help that after all the excitement, it felt as if his stomach had

       <span class="bold">

        A smartly-dressed waiter sat them at a table set for two and handed each of them a leather-bound menu. Foreign-looking words in a cursive font were printed in neat rows on the white paper. Illustrations of the entrées would’ve been helpful. Dolfengra flipped to the

The bucket of ice was fancy, having been made from clear acrylic so that the shark could see the ice and wine bottle within.

        The shark turned to Sephos. His scales glowed beneath the lights. His sapphire-blue eyes stared straight into his soul. Dolfengra couldn’t feel his feet; it was as if they were already drifting in the ocean with each other for company.

        Sephos motioned to a contract on the bedside table, and Dolfengra nodded. He put his glass of wine down as his eyes skimmed over the words. He was giving consent to the snake to make him his sub, slave, and plaything. Steadying his trembling hands, he signed it.

        His jacket, shirt and pants were off within seconds. He tugged his underwear down, unveiling his member. It had already emerged from his cock slit, erect and eager. He resisted giving his member a squeeze. Not without his master’s permission.

        The shark climbed onto the bed, feeling it shift beneath him. The levitating bed was surprisingly stable as if strong springs were supporting it. Combined with the aquatic ambience, he could almost imagine himself in the ocean. He climbed into the middle of the king-sized bed and knelt facing Sephos.

        Sephos took off his jacket and hung it on a coat rack. His tie came off next, followed by the buttons on his shirt. The shark watched in earnest and anticipation. Each button undone revealed a little more of the snake’s scales; just enough to tease but not enough to satisfy. Dolfengra could’ve sworn Sephos was doing it on purpose.

        His pants came off next, and finally his tight, black trunks. Sephos hung his pants on the rack, but he held his underwear in his hand. His manhood still hidden, tucked away in his genital slit. The shark could not help but be impressed by his self-control. Sephos gave Dolfengra a smug smirk before climbing onto the bed.

        The shark nodded with a whimper, and Sephos let go of his muzzle. Still holding the shark in his arms, the serpent pushed deeper into his slave. Dolfengra closed his eyes and winced. Sephos was bigger than he expected, and he wasn’t prepared to be stretched that much. The snake, however, was gentle, slowly easing the shark lower upon his sceptre.

        Sephos slowly pulled out, allowing the shark some relief before plunging back into him. Dolfengra wanted to struggle, but his hands were holding Sephos’ arms tightly, and his legs and tail were restrained by the snake’s powerful tail; there was not much space to move.

        In and out Sephos thrust, filling out the shark’s hole. The shark had never been used like this before, and the experience was scary and humiliating. Deep inside, however, he knew he wanted this. His desire to be an obedient slave was fulfilled each time Sephos shafted him. His cock was at full mast, leaking his clear precum onto the sheets.

        The cold was making his cock lose its erection. As it turned limp, Sephos picked up an object. It looked like a condom: a flat, circular object made out of latex. The serpent put it over the tip of the shark’s cock and slowly unrolled it. The stretchy latex gripped his shaft tightly, squeezing its entire length as Sephos pulled the last of the latex on, concealing every inch of the shark’s manhood.

        As Dolfengra complied, the serpent teased his cock, arousing the shark to his resentment. Each stroke and pump made things worse. His precum coated the sensitive flesh of his cock, trapped beneath the shiny latex skin.

       Dolfengra the shark is attracted to Sephos after having seen him around for days in the Silver Serpent. He gathers the courage to ask the snake out for lunch, and then to be his master. To his relief, Sephos agrees. Sephos brings the shark up to his room and makes him sign a slave contract. He then hypnotises Dolfengra, bringing him into a trance and out again. After that, he penetrates the shark’s rear. Sephos puts the shark’s cock in a chastity sleeve, tucks it back into the shark’s genital slit, and then slit-fucks with his two cocks. He also fucks Dolfengra’s rear with his tail, and thrusts his tongue into the shark’s mouth. He brings Dolfengra back into a trance and cums into his slit. Sephos then orders Dolfengra to put on a full latex suit before welding a collar onto the shark. The shark is granted a brief moment of lucidity to realise his fate before Sephos brings him into a trance permanently.
