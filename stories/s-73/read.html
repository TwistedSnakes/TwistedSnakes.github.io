It\u2019s a chance for slaves to live a better life under the ownership of a new master. But when a clumsy kobold becomes the property of a powerful sorcerer, he finds that his mistakes have bigger consequences than ever.", "summary": "After years of training as a slave, a kobold is sold to a powerful dragon sorcerer to be his apprentice. However, the kobold makes several mistakes.\nHe makes his first mistake when he forgets a herb while buying potion ingredients. His master restrains him in stocks in the town square, before leaving him to buy the missing ingredient. In the meantime, two people fuck him in the mouth and tailhole. Someone ties a bucket to his balls, allowing for donations that will increase the weight on his manhood. More people fuck him, throwing in coins and rocks into his bucket before he's finally freed by his dragon master.\nThe second mistake happens during mana collection. His master had locked him in a chastity cage the day before that had stimulated him incessantly without letting him climax. When the dragon takes the cage off and teases him, the kobold shoots his load too early before the dragon can collect his mana-infused cum. The dragon punishes him by locking him in a spiked helmet and chastity cage for a few days.\nThe third mistake happens when he breaks a potion vial, releasing corrosive fumes into the air that destroy his master's alchemy books. His master punishes him by making him squat over a metal rod so that it spreads his tailhole open. A second rod mounted on a tabletop is shoved down this throat so it forces him to straighten his neck and face the ceiling. A vase is placed on the tabletop, forcing him to act as a table until the next day.\nHe falls asleep, waking up to an angry dragon and a broken vase. However, the dragon has more important matters on hand: he is casting a spell that requires an assistant. However, during the spell, the kobold forgets the incantations, causing the spell to fail and almost killing the dragon.\nThe kobold begs for mercy, saying that he'll do his best as a mana supply until he can be the sorcerer's apprentice. The dragon decides to make the kobold his permanent mana supply. Turning a steel cube into liquid metal, he encases the kobold in it and shapes him into a small cube. The kobold's dick hangs out of its side, and his mouth is now a hole at the bottom of the cube.\nThe milking chastity cage is locked over his dick to stimulate him. The spiked chastity cage is locked over the first cage, allowing the spikes to slide between the gaps and poke the kobold's cock. The metal is hardened, turning the kobold into a permanent mana tap.\nThe mouth of the kobold-turned-cube is placed over a dildo which acts as the kobold's feeding tube. The dragon casts a spell to milk the kobold dry, and then some.\nThe kobold has made his last mistake.", "commissioners": ["Doopnoop"], "authors": ["TwistedSnakes"], "illustrators": [], "tags": ["anal penetration", "anal sex", "bad end", "bondage", "character - Dii (Doopnoop)", "character - Millma (LordZylok)", "character - Summer (Summerlong)", "character - Unnamed Dragon (Doopnoop)", "chastity", "cock and ball torture", "cock gag", "collar", "encasement", "fellatio", "forniphilia", "gag", "gay", "male", "male/male", "master", "master/slave", "metal", "milking", "non-consent", "orgasm", "orgasm denial", "overstimulation", "pain", "permanent", "point of view - third person", "post-orgasm torture", "public play", "punishment", "restraints", "slave", "species - dragon", "species - goat", "species - kobold", "species - llama", "spit-roast", "stimulation", "stocks", "torture"], "display_tags": ["Master - Male dragon", "Slave - Male kobold", "Spitroast - Male goat and unknown male on male kobold", "Forced anal and oral sex in public", "Cock and ball torture", "Chastity", "Orgasm denial", "Milking", "Forniphilia", "Cock gag", "Permanent metal encasement in cube", "Non-consent", "Bad end"], "data": {"furaffinity_upload_url": "https://www.furaffinity.net/view/36598624/", "sofurry_upload_url": "https://www.sofurry.com/view/1585227", "furaffinity_tags": ["master", "slave", "gay", "male", "bondage", "collar", "public", "spitroast", "spit_roast", "oral", "anal", "sex", "cbt", "cock", "ball", "torture", "chastity", "orgasm", "denial", "milking", "forniphilia", "encase", "encasement", "cock", "gag", "overstimulation", "permanent", "noncon", "nonconsent"]}, "is_listed": true};

        Slave didn’t know what rights were, nor did he know what dignity, equality, liberty, and freedom were. All he knew was that he was an entity to be owned, a labourer for work, and an object for entertainment.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Slave didn’t know what a name was, nor did he have one of his own. All he knew was that if he was called—be it “boy”, “slave”, “thing”, or otherwise—he was to answer immediately or there would be consequences.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">

        Slave didn’t know what a marketplace was, nor had he even been to one. All he knew were the four walls of a prison that was his home. The only people he saw were his captors, trainers, and tormentors. He watched nervously through the metal bars of his cramped cage, staring at people who stared back out of curiosity. Only tattered leather briefs hid his dignity, another concept alien to him.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">

       <span>
        The morning sun rose over cottages made of stone and wood, casting shadows over the cart as it made its way to the centre of town. Everything Slave saw was new to him, and anything new was usually bad. He was stuck in a metal cage, crammed full of slaves just like him. He was forced against the walls of the cage with his legs sticking out between the bars.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        A rabbit had his back pressed against his, and a llama was forced to sit cross-legged beside him. Their wrists were bound together with cuffs, and a heavy metal chain linked them together. The llama’s face was covered with dust stirred up by the cart’s wheels, and Slave guessed that his face must’ve looked the same.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        His sit bones were sore by the time the cart came to a halt. People crowded around the cart, eager to see what the slave trader had brought to town.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        “Make way, make way!” the wolf snapped as he got off the cart.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The crowd parted around him as he made his way to the back. Taking out his jingling keys, he unlocked the rusty padlock to the metal cage. His partner, a burly rhino, opened the door of the cage and jerked on the chain.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The first slave yelped as his arms were jerked forward, causing him to stumble out of the cart. The lash of a whip on his back punished him for his involuntary outburst, and he stifled his second yelp.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The other slaves followed suit, obeying the order that the chains dictated for them. Five slaves were in front of Slave before it was his turn to get out of the cart. The llama followed behind him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        They were led up to a wooden platform. Pillories were positioned in intervals along the platform, each ready to restrain a slave. One by one, the slaves were unchained and forced into the pillories.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Slave shifted nervously from foot to foot. The conditions with the slave trader weren’t great, but there were no promises that his new owner would take care of him either. “No mistakes!” he remembered his trainers screaming at him. Make no mistakes, and he’ll be fine. He turned to the llama.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The llama nodded at him with a weary smile. His face looked like he aged twenty years during their few hours in the cart. Slave smiled back, feeling a little more reassured.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        “Hey!”
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Slave turned to see the rabbit slave dashing off the platform and into the crowd. His cuffs laid unlocked in front of the pillory that was meant for him. The rhino roared furiously and chased after him, leaving the wolf cursing and swearing on the platform. He came up to Slave with the keys to his cuffs.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Slave bit his lip.
       </span>
       <span class="italic">
        Did he dare?
       </span>
       <span>
        Out of the corner of his eye, he could make out some movement. The llama was shaking his head. Slave returned a pleading look, but the llama’s face of concern weakened his resolve. He watched as his brief moment of freedom was snatched away as the board was lowered over his neck and wrists.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        A click of the lock secured him in place. He’d only get out of the pillory if a new owner bought him, or when the slave trader packed up for the day. From the stories that the llama had told him in hushed whispers in the night, he knew that going back unsold meant being whipped and starved for weeks. Slave guessed that’s how the llama got the scars and permanent welts on his back but he didn’t ask about them.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The burly rhino came back, pushing brusquely through the crowd before climbing onto the platform. Under his arm was a brown ragged figure that Slave could barely recognise as the rabbit. A swelling over the rabbit’s right eye kept it half-closed, and the purple bruises discoloured the skin beneath his fur.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The rhino grumbled as he forced the rabbit into the pillory, making sure that a corner of the boards pinched his skin. The rabbit gasped in pain, earning him a whip on the back.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        “Try escaping and I’ll make sure you never run again,” the rhino threatened. “I doubt anyone will buy you with a face like that, so I’ll have a lot of time to break you down.” He chuckled.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The rabbit was too weak to respond, hanging limply in his restraints. Slave watched. A part deep inside him felt sorry for the rabbit. But years of training taught him that there was no space for pity in this world. Masters had no pity for slaves, and slaves were struggling to cope as is, much less feel pity for others.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        People stared and watched the slaves as if they were goods in a shop window. Slave looked as a tiger dressed in a fine tunic came up to the platform. He started with the slave in the first row, giving him a thorough examination. The slave trader rushed over eagerly with a greedy smile on his face.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        “Interested in this young slave? Smart choice, I can see you have good taste. He has muscles to carry your heavy goods to the market. Wash his face up, and he’ll be a handsome hunk for you to show off to your guests. What do you say, eh?”
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The tiger waved him off and continued his examination.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        “His fur is yellowing and coming off in patches,” he commented. “I’m not looking to bring any disease into my household.”
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        “Ah, sorry sir, sorry,” the wolf hastily bowed, grumbling beneath his breath. Standing up straight with a bright smile, he waved his hand towards the next slave. “Come, try the next one.”
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        One by one, the tiger examined the slaves, judging their physical health, mental stability, and muscle strength. He gave the battered rabbit a look of disgust before moving onto the next slave.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        He didn’t give Slave a second glance before walking over to the llama.

        “Wonderful choice! This slave is very experienced. See the whips on his back? He’s been domesticated since young, and has served in many households before coming into our possession.”

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The slave trader collected the money greedily before nodding at the rhino. Taking the keys from the wolf, the rhino unlocked the pillory. The llama experienced a brief moment of freedom before ropes around his wrist took it away. The other end of the rope was handed to the tiger, who pulled him away.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Slave watched as he saw the last of those scars and welts disappear into the crowd. Feeling lonelier than ever, he watched as other potential buyers examined the other slaves. Nobody paid any attention to him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The sun rose overhead, bearing heavily down upon the slaves. The slave trader and his partner sat in the shade of a canvas shelter off the side of the platform, having their lunch of wrapped rice and dried dates.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        More buyers came and left, and one by one the other slaves disappeared until only Slave and the rabbit were left. The crowd had dissipated, leaving only a few people milling about in the town square as they finished up their chores for the day.

        Slave whimpered and shifted his feet. Maybe he’d get scars and welts of his own, just like the llama. He stared at the cobblestone on the ground, tracing his eyes over the gaps as if they were the walls of a maze and he was trying to escape.

        “Oh great one, are you here to replace your previous slave? My utmost condolences for the accident. I’m afraid there’s only two slaves left for you. Perhaps if you came in the morning, I can let you have the first pick. I have the best slaves in town. Strong, muscular ones who can—”

        Slave watched the dragon through the corner of his eye. The dragon’s robes must’ve been made of an otherworldly material, shimmering beneath the glow of the setting sun. Its black material contrasted his bright red scales.

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The top of the robes consisted of a sleeveless shirt, showing off the curves of his sculpted arms and chest. His pants were form-fitting, and a rope belt held a wide strip of cloth between his legs. He strode across the platform with an air of elegance. If not for the wolf’s excessive pleasantries, Slave would have assumed the dragon was royalty.

        “Are you sure? He doesn’t usually look like this,” the wolf said. “A lout picked a fight with him, roughing him up before we could rescue him. Poor rabbit didn’t even raise a finger to defend himself, bless his soul. Just wash him up, good as new!”

        The dragon ignored him, standing in front of Slave. Slave craned his neck to look at the dragon. His eyes seemed to glow dark and Slave could’ve sworn there were entire universes swimming in his eyes. They disappeared as the dragon blinked, replaced with an expression of intrigue.

        The wolf would normally have bargained for more, but he feared the wizard’s wrath. He nodded, collected the money, and unlocked Slave’s pillory. The dragon took out a glowing blue leash from his pocket and clasped its end around Slave’s neck.

        The wolf nodded meekly with his tail between his legs and the rhino scoffed. Ignoring the pair, the sorcerer led Slave off the platform. They went down the winding streets in silence. Slave watched the dragon in front of him. His mesmerising robes had two slits in the back for his half-open wings. A flap at the top of his pants allowed his tail to sway behind him.

        Slave had many questions. What was the dragon like? Was he a nice or cruel master? What kind of house did he live in? What kind of tasks would he be assigned? But unwarranted questions would be met with punishment, and so he kept quiet.
       </span>

        The dragon brought him out of town and into the vast countryside. Instead of following the roads, however, the dragon led him into a grass field. Opening his mouth, the dragon breathed flames into the air. Sparkling tongues of fire shot into the sky, coming down to engulf them in a swirling storm. Slave panicked, barely managing to stifle his yelp.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The fire dissipated. The town and the field had disappeared, and they were in the clearing of a quiet forest. A path led through the shrubs to the doorstep of a small, thatched cottage only one storey high. For a powerful wizard, the dragon had a modest abode.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The door opened as they approached the house. As Slave stepped through the doorway, he was greeted by a large stone hall that was many times bigger than the size of the cottage. A flight of stairs led to walkways on the second and third floors, each with corridors leading down to other parts of the house. The dragon lived in a castle, tucked away in the facade of the quaint cottage.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The door closed behind them and the sorcerer turned around to face Slave. He took the leash off Slave and tucked it into the pocket of his robes. Holding his hand up, he pressed his palm against Slave’s exposed chest, and a burning sensation seared through the kobold’s body. Slave closed his eyes and gritted his teeth. He was not to protest, not to defend himself, and not to question. Slaves only obeyed.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The pain faded away once the dragon took his hand off Slave’s chest, leaving behind a fresh scar. The scar took the form of a draconic figure on the left side of his chest, infused with residual magic.

        “Now that you are marked as mine, I would like to welcome you to my place of residence,” the dragon waved his hand to the side as if presenting the rest of the castle. “I, too, am tired, so I will make this quick. As my slave, I will put only one rule in place: you will obey every command I give you without question. You may ask only to clarify, but anything else will not be tolerated. Is that understood?”

        Slave waited for the sorcerer to head up the stairs and disappear around a corridor before he made for his room. He gingerly opened the door to find a neatly made bed with clean sheets. An empty chest sat against the wall of the room for his belongings. He didn’t have anything to his name, but he appreciated the intention.

        A fresh set of brown robes and sandals were set nicely in the corner of the room. A collar made of pristine leather sat atop the clothes. Beside them was a jug of water and clean towels. Slave took off his briefs. Soaking the towel with water, he wiped the sweat and dust from his scales. Finally clean for the first time in weeks, he put on his new clothes and collar, and got into bed.

        Instead of straw, the mattress was stuffed with feathers and wool. Far more comfortable than the stone-cold floors that he was used to sleeping on. As the soft cotton caressed him to sleep, his thoughts flickered to his new master. His new master seemed alright so far, but looks could be deceiving.

        If it was any sign of what to expect, his master had shown more care for him today than the slave traders did throughout his training. The dragon had paid good money for him; now Slave needed to prove his worth.

        They came to a square in the middle of town where bigger stalls were set up. Boisterous shopkeepers touted their colourful wares, eager to catch the attention of passersby.

        The dragon strode away, leaving Slave to ponder on the meaning of Master’s words. He didn’t need long, for there was the sound of footsteps behind him. A warm, firm feeling of someone’s member slipped between his butt cheeks and nudged against his tailhole.

        The unknown stranger paid him no heed. The phallus pushed into his rear entrance and spread his insides open. Slave howled in pain as his virgin hole was used against his will. He strained against his restraints, trying in vain to escape the rod that was thrust deep into him.

        Slave was greeted with someone’s crotch in his face. He craned his neck upwards to see a goat grinning at him. Turning his head away, he avoided the shaft that the goat was pulling out of his pants.

        A strong paw grabbed the top of his head, forcing him to face the front. Another hand pushed between his teeth, prying his jaw open. Slave whimpered as the person behind him thrust with exceptional force, nudging the hefty member’s tip against Slave’s sensitive prostate.

        Slave nodded reluctantly. The goat shoved his member into his mouth before the kobold could ready himself. His tongue was pinned beneath the girth of the shaft. He choked as its tip triggered his gag reflex, but the fingers in his maw held his mouth wide open.

        It felt like a long time before his assailants got close to finishing. People watched as the goat roared, pumping the kobold’s maw full of cum. A few seconds later, Slave’s rump was also filled with warm, sticky fluids.

        He tilted the kobold’s head upwards, putting him in an uncomfortable position. There was no stopping it as the goat’s seed streamed to the back of his mouth. Slave clenched his throat.

        The kobold gulped it down reluctantly, feeling a warm and dirty flowing down his gullet. The goat seemed satisfied as he dragged his cock across Slave’s face, wiping off the residual cum. He pulled his pants up and walked away, unfazed by the crowd that had come to watch.

        The setting sun cast an orange glow over the town. The afternoon crowd had long left, leaving Slave standing in his agonising pose. His head was hung down in the stocks and his jaw was tired from overuse. Residual cum dripped from his gaping tailhole and into the bucket that was tied to his balls.

        His clothes had been tossed to the side. His abusers had earlier cleaned themselves off with it and it was now soaked with their fluids. Trying to hide his disgust, he put the dirty clothes on before chasing after Master. The dragon was already halfway down a connecting street and the kobold had to run to catch up.

        Slave didn’t like the punishment, but then again punishments weren’t meant to be pleasant. After all, he did make a mistake and he had to be disciplined. But if the dragon’s methods were as sadistic as this, he dreaded finding out what else the dragon was capable of.

        Cleaning the castle quickly turned into a mundane chore. Slave had to replace the burnt-out torches, clean the dirty statues in the halls, polish the grimy suits of armour in the corridor, and sweep the dusty floor. He wasn’t sure if Master had even set foot into the rest of the castle in the three weeks he was here.

        The dragon’s alchemical laboratory, however, was a different story. It was located at the top of the highest tower of the castle, up a circular flight of stairs and behind a door sealed by protection spells. The first week he was here, he barely caught a glimpse of the inside. Only when he brought the dragon’s meals to him could he see just a little bit of the magical wonders that went on inside, and smell the heavenly scents wafting from within.

        Slave could barely contain his excitement when Master finally trusted him enough to let him clean up the laboratory. Enchanted artefacts and bewitched curios covered every surface of the wooden tables and shelves that lined the room’s stone walls. A draconic skull with four horns sat on a table with a mysterious glow coming from within. Wind chimes hung in front of the open window, singing an eerie tune as if it were alive. A set of spare robes hung from the antler-like hooks of an oddly-shaped metal coat rack.

        Each time he was allowed in, there would be new trinkets to look at. Master had forbidden Slave from touching anything, but it didn’t stop the curious kobold from peering at them as they glowed, shuddered, hummed, and danced.

        Today, however, he was distracted as he organised a shelf of thick leather-bound spellbooks. A moan barely escaped his lips before he stopped himself.

        The kobold hastily shove the half-sorted books back onto the shelf and scampered to the other side of the laboratory. The dragon was tweaking the knobs to a brewing apparatus made of connected flasks and coloured liquids.

        Slave eagerly removed his clothes and folded them in the corner before standing at attention behind the dragon. His member sported an intricately-designed chastity cage. Steel ribs curved around his pink shaft, held together by a central metal rod. Runic symbols were inscribed on the bars of the device, pulsing with blue ethereal energy.

        Master had caged his member the day before, securing it with sealing spells. Its enchantments had kept him perpetually aroused throughout the day and during his sleep. Yet the very same enchantments had stopped him from climaxing, no matter how much he stroked his throbbing cock through the bars of the cage. All the denial made for a very potent concoction of mana.

        The dragon stormed out of the room, leaving the kobold restrained. When he came back, he held metal objects in his hands. One looked like the helmet of a suit of armour, except it was angular in form and had no eyeholes. The other was a small chastity device.

        Slave complied. The dragon lifted one half of the helmet, revealing blunt spikes lining its inside. The kobold shivered, closing his eyes as the dragon put it over his head. The sounds of the outside world went silent, replaced with the sound of metal latches. He could feel the spikes press into his skin from all sides.

        He didn’t want to think about it. Sleep that night didn’t come easy. The helmet made it painful to lie in bed, and trying to adjust it was agonising. Nightmares about messing up potions and spells made him toss and turn in his sleep, only to be woken up by the spikes in his face.

        Master wasn’t as nice as Slave had initially thought, but it was also due to his own blunders that the dragon had to punish him. The dragon was still nicer than the sadistic slave traders who would beat him up for no reason. Master, after all, knew the dangers of magic and was only trying to protect him, right?

        Feeling with his fingers, Slave positioned the plates on the tray so that the weight was balanced when he lifted it. Taking small, slow steps, he made his way towards the alchemical laboratory. What should’ve been a simple trip was hard without his sense of vision. Bumping into walls poked spikes into his face, causing him to almost drop the tray a number of times. He also got lost on several occasions, misjudging the distance he had walked and going down the wrong corridor.

        The hours seemed to inch along slowly, just like the strip of sunlight crawling across the stone floor. The light gradually turned orange and narrow, before eventually disappearing. Without Slave to light the torches in the castle, the hall was pitch-black and cold.

        Sleepiness began to creep over him, and he struggled to stay awake. If he dozed off, it would be all over for him. He needed to hold on. He thought of the llama. Where was he now? Hopefully his new master was treating him well.

        The kobold hastily put his pants back on. He could tend to his sore tailhole later. The dragon brought him up to the alchemical laboratory. The furniture in the room had been shifted aside to make space in the middle where a draconic skull set. On the floor around it, an intricate pattern of inscriptions and concentric circles were painted with red ink. The dragon’s right hand was wrapped in a blood-stained bandage.

        He could feel the dragon tap on his box. A warmth filled his dick, stimulating him with a steady vibration. His shaft strained against the cage, pushing against the metal. Despite his pain, the dragon further teased his erection, forcing the kobold’s dick to fill a space too small for it.

        Pain and pleasure flooded his mind relentlessly. His body was sweaty and his cock was throbbing. He could feel the adrenaline rush accompany his rising arousal. His instincts fought the enclosing metal as he tried to thrust his hips.

        Slave climaxed, shooting his generous load through the slit of the spiked cage. The dragon collected the white liquid in a vial and swirled it around.

        The steady stream of liquid fed the kobold, slowly filling up his empty stomach until his hunger was satisfied. But the rest of him was far from comfortable; the permanence of his predicament began to set in, and regret filled his mind. He should’ve let Master send him back to the slave traders. He should’ve tried to run away when he got the chance. He should’ve been more careful. He shouldn’t have made mistakes.

      Trading day is a big day for slaves. It’s a chance for slaves to live a better life under the ownership of a new master. But when a clumsy kobold becomes the property of a powerful sorcerer, he finds that his mistakes have bigger consequences than ever.
     </p>
     <div class="story-info-summary-container">
      <p class="story-info-summary">
       After years of training as a slave, a kobold is sold to a powerful dragon sorcerer to be his apprentice. However, the kobold makes several mistakes.
       <br/>
       He makes his first mistake when he forgets a herb while buying potion ingredients. His master restrains him in stocks in the town square, before leaving him to buy the missing ingredient. In the meantime, two people fuck him in the mouth and tailhole. Someone ties a bucket to his balls, allowing for donations that will increase the weight on his manhood. More people fuck him, throwing in coins and rocks into his bucket before he's finally freed by his dragon master.
       <br/>
       The second mistake happens during mana collection. His master had locked him in a chastity cage the day before that had stimulated him incessantly without letting him climax. When the dragon takes the cage off and teases him, the kobold shoots his load too early before the dragon can collect his mana-infused cum. The dragon punishes him by locking him in a spiked helmet and chastity cage for a few days.
       <br/>
       The third mistake happens when he breaks a potion vial, releasing corrosive fumes into the air that destroy his master's alchemy books. His master punishes him by making him squat over a metal rod so that it spreads his tailhole open. A second rod mounted on a tabletop is shoved down this throat so it forces him to straighten his neck and face the ceiling. A vase is placed on the tabletop, forcing him to act as a table until the next day.
       <br/>
       He falls asleep, waking up to an angry dragon and a broken vase. However, the dragon has more important matters on hand: he is casting a spell that requires an assistant. However, during the spell, the kobold forgets the incantations, causing the spell to fail and almost killing the dragon.
       <br/>
       The kobold begs for mercy, saying that he'll do his best as a mana supply until he can be the sorcerer's apprentice. The dragon decides to make the kobold his permanent mana supply. Turning a steel cube into liquid metal, he encases the kobold in it and shapes him into a small cube. The kobold's dick hangs out of its side, and his mouth is now a hole at the bottom of the cube.
       <br/>
       The milking chastity cage is locked over his dick to stimulate him. The spiked chastity cage is locked over the first cage, allowing the spikes to slide between the gaps and poke the kobold's cock. The metal is hardened, turning the kobold into a permanent mana tap.
       <br/>
       The mouth of the kobold-turned-cube is placed over a dildo which acts as the kobold's feeding tube. The dragon casts a spell to milk the kobold dry, and then some.
       <br/>
       The kobold has made his last mistake.
