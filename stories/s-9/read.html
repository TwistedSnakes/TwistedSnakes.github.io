        Under the light of a dimly-lit supply room, two reptiles were packing supplies into their leather messenger bags. These bags were aptly named seeing that the two of them were tasked with the job of delivering a message.
       </span>

        Seglagg the lizard was examining the map. The path would lead them through the winding hills of Isolon, across the River of the Glen then through the woods of Maplehallow. "Pack for two days of trekking," he told his partner.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The dragon grunted in response. His bag had been filled with five days' worth of rations, way more than enough. "Always be prepared!" he thought, smirking to himself. He slung his bag over his shoulders waiting for the lizard to be done.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Seglagg in the meantime had picked out some light leather boots to hike across the mountains, a long length of rope that would get them across the river, and two days worth of rations. "Okay Crestor, I'm hurrying up," he rolled his eyes. He went over to the weapons rack and picked up a short dagger, feeling its weight.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        "I didn't say anything," Crestor shrugged.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "But you're thinking it," Seglagg retorted.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        He chose two daggers which he was comfortable using in two-handed combat and slid them into the dagger sheaths along his leather belt.

        "You know I can fly you across the river right?" Crestor stated, showing off his wings. His giant two-handed sword was sitting in a sheath hanging between his wings.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Yeah, I know," Seglagg responded.

        "I like being able to handle things for myself, thank you very much," the lizard snapped back.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Crestor shrugged again. "Okay, suit yourself."

        "-to the guild's base in Dawnfell," Crestor finished up. "Yes, I know."

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "This message is of utmost importance to the guild. It concerns the future of us all. It wouldn't kill you to take this a little more seriously," Seglagg snapped. "Got all the supplies you need?"
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "It's just a simple errand. Two days! We'll be done. Lighten up," he slapped Seglagg on the back.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Seglagg massaged his back where the dragon had hit him. "Stop that," he called. "If we're done here we should start. I want to cross the river by nightfall."

        They exited the room, going up some dirt stairs onto the ground level. A wolf was standing guard at the end of the corridor in front of a sturdy wooden door with a slotted peephole. They walked towards the door, taking off the bandanas on their right arms. The bandanas were jet-black in colour except for a shiny silver feather, the insignia of the Silverwell guild, embroidered into the fabric. They tucked it carefully into a secret compartment their respective messenger bags. As the Silverwell guild wasn't an official guild but a notorious mercenary clan, the bandanas would not be well-received outside. Still, it was their uniforms and identities within the confines of the clan and they had to wear it within the clan's many bases.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Morning Alaez!" Seglagg greeted the wolf. Crestor grunted as he followed behind Seglagg.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Mornin'. Too early for this," the wolf mumbled.

        They gently pushed the door open and checked if the town street was clear. Closing the door behind them and hearing the sound of at least five latches, locks and chains, they made their way through the winding streets of Fairwatch.

        The moon was hanging overhead in the night sky, beaming its rays down on the two travelling mercenaries. Crestor was trudging his way through the tall grass field and Seglagg was following behind. Seglagg was dripping wet and his feet sunk into the mud with each step. The two tired travellers entered the Maplehallow woods.
       </span>

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "So, how was the river?" Crestor taunted. He opened up another bag of rations and began chomping on the dried strips of meat it contained.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Shut up," the lizard retorted. "Not my fault the wind was too strong."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Uh huh," Crestor said unconvinced. "I did offer to fly you across. Twenty times."
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "We should take a break soon," Seglagg changed the subject. "How does three hours of sleep sound?"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Sure," Crestor replied.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Suddenly, there was a whirring sound and a bolas flew at Crestor binding his arm to the tree behind him. "What the-" he called out. "Get down!"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Seglagg ducked as another one flew above his head, wrapping itself around the tree behind him. "Damn!" he took out a dagger and cut Crestor free. "Let's go!"
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Bent low, the two of them ran deeper into the forest twisting their way through shrubs and brambles. They could hear the sound of footsteps chasing after them. It was definitely the sound of a group of people. There was a whizzing sound and a burst of orange energy struck the tree in front of them. "Shit, they're using magic!" Seglagg shouted. They swerved to avoid the burning tree and Seglagg threw a magic missile towards their unseen hunters. There was a scream as one of them went down, but the rest continued advancing on them.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Crestor grabbed Seglagg under his arms, spread his wings and took off into the canopy of the forest. Finding a thick cluster of leaves and branches, they hid in silence. Escaping into the night sky would just make them more vulnerable to flying spells and the resultant fall would not be worth the trouble. "Who are they?" Crestor whispered.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Not a clue," Seglagg whispered back.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Their hunters ran through the undergrowth below them, bearing the armour of the King's guards. "We lost them. Finlay, do your thing," a voice called out. There was a sphere of light that burst out from the group, and the eagle named Finlay turned to look at their direction.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Run!" Crestor yelled, grabbing Seglagg and flying through the trees. Spells bursts at them from below and a bolas came up and tied the lizard's feet together. A beam of green light shot through the trees in front of Crestor, and he dodged it, flying into the path of a spell. His body tensed up and he let go of Seglagg. The both of them tumbled through branches and landed on the muddy ground.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Ugh," the lizard groaned. He landed on his right shoulder and now it ached like there was no tomorrow. "Hey. Crestor? We gotta go." He grabbed his dagger and cut the ropes at his ankles. Holding his shoulder, he got up and limped away. He must have twisted his ankle during their landing. "Crestor?" There was no response from the fallen dragon.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Fuck fuck fuck," he cursed, turning back and running over to Crestor. "Wake up you big doofus. This is no time for a stupid nap." He pushed the dragon over so that he was lying on his wings. Crestor's eyes were open but he wasn't responding. Seglagg felt for a pulse and was relieved to feel the comforting beat of the dragon's heart. Good, still alive. "Damn, must be a stun spell," he grumbled. The troops were coming soon. There was no time.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        There was a paper charm hanging around the dragon's neck and Seglagg sliced its cord, hiding the charm in his jacket pocket. "Sorry, buddy. I'll come back for you." He got off and ran into the forest.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "The other one's escaping!" a soldier called out, pointing at the running lizard. They gave chase, shooting spells haphazardly in Seglagg's direction. He dodged the spells as he hurtled through the forest, blindly throwing spells in retaliation. A vine tripped him and he fell. "Argh!" He got up and continued running. How much longer would they stay on his heels? With his sprained ankle, he couldn't keep this up for long. Suddenly a burst of energy struck him in the back and he landed face-first in the mud.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Damn it!" he cursed in his mind. There wasn't any choice left for him. He put the dirtied charm in his mouth and chewed, swallowing the wad of paper. The soldiers gathered around him with wands and spears pointed at him.
       </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Knock him out," a voice commanded. A burst of energy hit Seglagg in his back, and the world went dark.

        There was a groaning sound as Seglagg came to. His whole body was aching with the effects of the blast. He opened his eyes and looked around. He was in a large stone dungeon cell with an iron wrought gate. His body was tied to a wooden pillar and his arms were bound behind it. His balance felt off too, as his tail was wedged between his back and the pillar.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        There was someone moving behind him out of sight. "Who's there?" he called out.

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Seg? You're here too?" the familiar voice of the dragon called out.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Okay? Okay?! You call this okay? I get captured in a fucking forest and find myself tied up in the royal dungeon and you say this is okay?" the dragon raged.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        "Hey, keep it down. Let's not alert the guards alright?" Seglagg cautioned. "I mean okay as in alive. Alive as in they didn't kill you after finding you stunned on the ground."

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        "Fine," Crestor grunted. "Wait. If you're here, who's delivering the message? Please tell me you got it to the guild."

        Just then, a tiger stepped into view from outside the cell. He was wearing a steel chest plate which had the king's coat of arms emblazoned across its chest. "Looks like you're both awake," he smirked. "It was a little exciting capturing you two, but now's where the real fun starts." The tiger grinned and snapped his fingers. Two rhinos unlocked the cell and got into it.

        As the first one untied Seglagg from the pillar, the other was dragging Crestor along the stone ground. Seglagg could see that the dragon was in a tight hogtie, bent into an uncomfortable position.

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The rhino untying Seglagg freed the lizard and pushed him hard against his back. "Move," he commanded in a deep voice. Seglagg followed Crestor and his guard, while the other guard followed behind.

        They came to another room filled with torture equipment. There were two torture racks in the middle of the room. Whips, chains and other menacing metal tools lined the tables along the walls. Crestor growled at the sight. Even from the ground, he could see enough to predict what was going to happen next.

        The tiger was waiting for them between the two racks with his arms crossed and a wooden baton in one fist. "Chain this one up to the rack," he instructed, pointing to Seglagg. "Leave the other on the ground." Seglagg was pushed against the rack and laid out. The metal shackles at the end were clamped on his wrists and ankles, and his tail was restrained in a metal brace near the bottom of the rack. Crestor was still lying on his side, bruised from being dragged along the ground.

        "I'll be asking the questions here, lizard." the tiger smirked. "And I don't think you're in any position to make demands either," he spat venomously at Crestor, pressing down his leather boot on the dragon's maw, causing him to wince in pain.

        "I'm Luke Jefferson and my friend here is Miles Gilbert," Seglagg lied. "We were travelling through the forest when you captured us. For no reason," he added. Crestor nodded in agreement from under the tiger's foot.

        "Well then, if that is so, then I wouldn't find anything incriminating in your bags, would I?" The tiger picked up the travellers' two messenger bags that were placed on the table. He shook out the first bag's contents and a damp coil of rope and a pack of food rations fell onto the floor. He moved on to the other bag and overturned it. Five empty wrappers of food rations floated to the ground, and a rolled-up scroll fell out.

        "And what do we have here?" Grinning, the tiger unrolled the scroll and read its contents aloud. "Letter to Mrs Gilbert. Dear mother, I hope you're doing well. I was watering the flowers and the roses remind me of you. I heard that-What the fuck is this shit?" the tiger threw the scroll to the ground. Seglagg stifled a grin. Enduring the bitter taste of the real message was worth the effort.

        "Well, I don't buy it." The tiger picked up a knife in one hand and the two leather bags in the other, he sliced the two bags in one swift motion. Two black bandanas fell out of them. Crestor and Seglagg stared at the cloths on the ground in horror. "Ah-hah! Looks like we found ourselves some Silverwell mercenaries." He dangled the bandanas in front of Seglagg's snout. "Got any more stories to tell? No? I didn't think so," he spat.

        "Wrong answer. Guards, take off his shirt," he commanded. One of the rhinos stepped forward. With a short dagger, he ripped the shirt and pulled it off the lizard, exposing the lizard's bare chest, leaving his thick leather pants on. In the meantime, the tiger went to pick up a whip. He snapped it through the air a few times creating a loud cracking sound.

        The two rhinos stepped forward. The first one unshackled Seglagg and tossed his limp body over his shoulder, careful not to touch his chest.

        The guards complied, taking the chair meant for the night watchman into the cell. "Now tie that lizard to it," he demanded. Seglagg was thrust into the chair and his arms we bound behind his back. Ropes wrapped under his arms and across his shoulders, securing him into the chair. His ankles were tied to the two chair legs in front. Having done their jobs, the two guards resumed their posts outside the cell.

He stopped struggling and softly trembled at the attention his cock was getting.

        "No worries, I have plans for you too. You won't be left out." He grabbed Crestor's wrists and lifted them over the dragon's head. "Argh!" he shouted in pain as his chest was stretched, pulling against his welts. Smirking, the tiger pulled Crestor's arms around the chair such that the dragon was kneeling and hugging Seglagg's thighs. He pulled Crestor's horns and positioned his mouth on top of Seglagg's dick. "Careful not to use your teeth like you tried with me. You don't want to be castrating your lizard friend, do you?" the tiger taunted.

        "Not sucking? I guess you need a little 'motivation'. Guards, bring me my fuck machine!" he barked. A prism-shaped metal device was brought to him. Attached to one side of the prism was a metal rod with a dildo made up of hard rubber.

      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Crestor growled as the dildo was pushed up his tight tailhole, going past the sphincter and filling him up. Seglagg winced in pain. "Teeth," he mumbled. Crestor grunted in response, widening his maw and carefully keeping his teeth away from the lizard.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        The tiger chanted some magic words as he pointed his paw towards the prism. The prism glowed, and the metal rod slowly began extending. The dildo slowly pushed its way up into Crestor's ass causing him to groan in a mixture of pain and pleasure. The force also pushed him towards Seglagg's member and he soon found the tip of the lizard's dick at the back of his throat. He stopped his gag reflex out of fear of biting Seglagg's sensitive member.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">
       <span>
        Reaching its highest point against Crestor's prostate, it began sliding back out. The tiger continued chanting, and the dildo began pumping up and down his ass. Crestor was forced to move back and forth, giving Seglagg unwilling fellatio. He was getting aroused against his will too, and his own hard member poked out from his slit, standing up at full length. He groaned in embarrassment. This was humiliating.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        Seglagg was also uncomfortable with the oral that his draconic partner was forced to give him, but it didn't matter. The pleasure was overwhelming, making it hard to think. All he wanted was more.

        "Well lizard, you said you wanted to be sucked on all night. How's Mr Dragon with oral? Not as good as me I suppose, but I need to go sleep. Ta ta~" he left the cell and the guards locked it behind him, leaving the two mercenaries engaged in unwilling oral sex.

        Seglagg could feel himself coming to a climax, but he held back. "Not into Crestor's mouth, please," he begged himself. However, the pressure was building. Release would be so good! He tried to hang on, but how long could he hold out for?

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-break">
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        After a few minutes, Seglagg whispered "I'm sorry," shooting his load down Crestor's throat. Crestor groaned. The cum was at the back of his throat and he was powerless to stop himself from swallowing it.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

        The machine, however, was not slowing down. Crestor's tailhole was still getting abused by the thick dildo, and Seglagg continued to receive unwilling fellatio.

        The next morning found them still in the same position. Overnight, Seglagg had fallen asleep a few times, waking up only to grunt apologies as he fed the sucking dragon another load of his seed.

        Crestor, on the other hand, looked worse for wear. He was kept awake with the ass pounding he was receiving and his jaw was sore from keeping it wide open. The whipping across his chest had been repeatedly pressed against the lizard's knees, staining the lizard's pants with his blood.

        There was a clanging sound as the tiger appeared at the cell door with the two guards, sliding his baton and hitting every metal bar on the cell. “Rest well?” he guffawed as his sense of humour. “Unlock the gate and bring them back to the interrogation room,” he ordered, leaving the guards to carry out his orders.

        The two rhinos untied Seglagg and Crestor. Lifting the tired dragon’s ass, a guard freed Crestor from his anal torture and kicked the infernal device to the side. Crestor groaned in relief as his gaping hole finally got to relax.

        The two of them were pushed out of the cell into the corridor. “Let us go,” Seglagg whispered. “We’ll make it worth your while.” The rhino grunted in response, ignoring the lizard’s desperate bargains. Crestor only followed silently with his head bent low. He would be grateful for some shuteye, although that was very likely to be out of the question.

        They reached the same torture chamber as before. This time, however, the two racks were adjusted so that they were slightly raised, forming a 45-degree angle with the floor. The racks were also rotated to face each other and a wooden hump was screwed a quarter from the top.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        “Lock them in,” the waiting tiger instructed. The two mercenaries soon found themselves shackled to the racks facing each other. Seglagg felt the hump press uncomfortably against his lower back. Leaning his head back against the rack forced him to lift his hips away from the hips, but resting his ass against the rack would lift his torso up. This was going to be pleasant. Seglagg rolled his eyes, dreading the torture that's soon to come.

        Seglagg looked across at Crestor who hung limply against his restraints. He didn't seem to have tried settling himself into the rack, but Seglagg didn't blame him. If not for the slow heaving of the dragon's chest, Seglagg would have thought that the dragon was dead. Making sure the tiger was out of sight he whispered to Crestor, "Hang in there buddy, I'll get us out of here." The dragon mumbled something in acknowledgement.

        Their interrogator came back from inspecting his instruments of torture. "So, has last night helped change your mind? Or do you need my tools to help loosen your tongues?" he asked, holding a whip in his paw.

        "Well, I guess you don't respond to the whipping. Maybe your friend here does?" The whip sliced across Crestor's chest, spilling more blood down his front. "Nghn," Crestor gasped from behind gritted teeth.

        "Dragon," the tiger held Crestor's jaw in his hand, turning his face towards him. "What was your business in the king's city of Dawnfell?" Crestor lifted his eyelids halfway and grunted feebly, too weak to answer.

        "No answer?" the tiger let go of his head and whipped Crestor again. "Does anyone here have any answer?" Seglagg kept his mouth shut. "Well then," the tiger lashed at Crestor with another whip. "Nnngh!" he endured.

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        "Fine by me," he took his whip and raised it high in the air. Seglagg closed his eyes and braced himself for the sting, but it never came. Instead, the crack was echoed with Crestor's cries of pain as Maurin rained blow after blow on the dragon.

        The tiger stopped his arm in the middle of another whip. "Oh? Did Mr lizard decide that he wants to tell me something?" he mocked condescendingly. Crestor raised his head a little to look at Seglagg and shake his head as if to say no.

        Seglagg ignored his silent pleas. He couldn't bear to see Crestor getting hurt like that, no matter how much he claimed he could withstand the pain. "I'll tell you everything. We were delivering a message to the Silverwell base in Dawnfell."

        The whip twitched in the tiger's right paw as he gripped it tighter. "You're in no position to make demands, lizard," he growled. "How about you tell me everything, and I'll consider not killing you with my bare claws?" the tiger threatened.

        Another whip sent Crestor jerking powerlessly against his shackles. His face was slightly damped by his tears of pain, but for the sake of Silverwell, he needed to endure this. He grunted to Seglagg, trying to tell his partner he'll be alright.

        "Liar! Liars all of you! Do you take me for a fool? I know for a fact that the Silverwell headquarters are located in the city of Dawnfell itself." He went up to Seglagg's shackled figure and slid a finger down the lizard's chest. "A-ah!" he gasped in pain as the claw slid down his welts and gashes.

        "Seeing that the both of you are still so reluctant to tell me anything, I'm beginning to think the both of you need a little more...'convincing'," he smirked. He picked up four metallic clamps and pinched them tightly on Crestor's and Seglagg's nipples. Seglagg groaned. The clamps felt like they were going to pull his nipples right off, and the burning sensation that accompanied the clamps was a little too much for him to bear.

        Maurin picked up a knife and ripped Seglagg's leather pants and underwear, leaving him nude. He did the same with Crestor, removing his loincloth. Picking up a length of rope, he looped it across Seglagg's member and circled it a few times around his individual testicle, pulling it tightly with each loop. "Ugh get off me!" Seglagg protested.

        The tiger ignored him and finished up his ropework with some knots. He tugged against the end of the rope, pulling Seglagg's dick forward. The lizard thrust his hips forward to lessen the pain as his shoulders slammed into the rack due to the hump. The tiger gave the rope a few more tugs. Satisfied that Seglagg's member was well-tied, he looped it over a metal ring that was screwed into the wooden beam on the ceiling.

      <div class="paragraph-break">

      <div class="paragraph align-left">

        The other end of the rope was threaded through the loops in Crestor's nipple clamps and tied securely. This time, Crestor lifted his upper back and rested his hips against the rack to ease the pain.

        Maurin stroked Crestor's crotch, slowly teasing out the dragon's member. Crestor grunted in response, too tired to even struggle. Any form of movement would only just serve to pull against his nipples, and seeing that his chest had endured enough, this was not something he'd look forward to doing.

        With the dragon's cock fully exposed, the tiger looped another set of rope around the dragon's member and knot, pulling it tightly. He looped the rope through another ring in the wooden beam, this time hanging it to a heavy weight and attached it to Seglagg's nipple clamps. With the hanging weight, if Crestor raised his hips, the weight would fall, dragging Seglagg's nipples upwards too.

        Time to test the setup. He tugged against the rope that held Crestor's throbbing member and the dragon roared in pain, lifting his hips off as his shoulders hit the rack. This motion caused the weight to fall, pulling against Seglagg's nipples. The lizard yelped in pain, instinctively leaning forward. The hump forced his hips backwards, pulling Crestor's nipples back up in a vicious cycle.

        "Wait wait wait. Crestor, try to balan-" Seglagg was interrupted as a muzzle was strapped around his maw "Mfft!" Seglagg mumbled. The rest of the muzzle had straps around it forming a harness and blindfold around the lizard's head. The blindfold was positioned over Seglagg's eyes, and the harness was tightly buckled over the rest of his head.

        "Nope, no communication. That would be cheating," the tiger grinned evilly. "Well to make this fair..." He went over to the bench and picked up a ball gag. He restrained Crestor's feebly struggles by holding the dragon's maw in a vice-like grip as he pushed the gag into Crestor's maw. Crestor made a muffled grunt from behind his ball gag.

        However, Maurin wasn't done yet. A thick leather rectangle with buckles was covered over his eyes and snapped into place. Now in the dark, Crestor moaned, reacting groggily to the tugs and pulls of his nipples and dick. The world was spinning around him so it didn't help that the pain made it harder to focus his mind.

        "Now, I'd like to stay and talk, but I have other prisoners to attend to. I might check on you two tomorrow," he pulled out a pocket watch. "Only early afternoon. Looks like you have at least twenty more hours to think about what you'd like to tell me," he exited the interrogation room, and the rhinos closed the door after him. "Have fun!"

        Seglagg leaned his back against the rack trying to get a little relief for his aching member. However, the tug on his nipples soon followed after. He tried to get his body balanced on the hump, hoping that Crestor would do the same.

        Seglagg yelped as Crestor dozed off, slumping against the rack. He yelped loudly through his muzzle, and there was a sleepy groan from the other side as Crestor woke up and attempted to balance himself. His abs were hurting from trying to keep himself straight against the hump, and he was sure the dragon would fall asleep soon and subject him to the pain of his body weight against his dick.

       Crestor the dragon and Seglagg the lizard are mercenaries on a mission to deliver a secret message to the next town. However, along the way, they are attacked and captured by the King's guards. Maurine the tiger, subjects them to interrogation and whipping. That night, Seglagg is tied to a chair and Crestor is forced to suck him off while a fuck machine abuses the dragon's tailhole. They are left in this position the entire night.
       <br/>
       The interrogations continue the next day, but the mercenaries, while injured and bleeding, refuse to tell the truth. Maurin binds them on racks, clamps their nipples and ties ropes around their cocks. Their nipples and cocks are tied together through a loop in the ceiling such that one person's movements will cause immense pain in the other person's cock and nipples. As they are left in the dungeons, they have no choice but to endure the agony as their movements inflict pain on each other.
